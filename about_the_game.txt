VR Astronomy and Geography Lab (Universe Spacecraft, Solar System, Earth, Moon, Relativity, Flying over the World, etc)<br>This laboratory contains 4 sub-games, which will allow you to experience the magnificence of the universe, the beauty of the earth, the wonder of the moon, and the very different world you see when driving a spaceship near the speed of light under the effect of relativity. Our team comes from the Department of Physics at California Institute of Technology and Oxford University, and incorporates physical science formulas into visual effects.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1346680/extras/1.png?t=1594255343" /><br><br>Lab scene 1: Space travelling within the Earth-Moon system<br><br>You will find yourself in the satellite control room, and you can observe this beautiful planet in the geostationary satellite orbit. You will see the Himalayas, the American metropolitan area, the Amazon forest, and the densely changing clouds. We reconstructed the earth of the virtual world with extremely high resolution! Of course, there is the moon as well, you will experience the Apollo moon landing, personally come to the surface of the moon, see countless impact craters, and look back from the moon to our hometown, the Earth! Just swing your controllers, and you will jump up and experience the moon’s special gravity field (much lower than it is on the Earth). Take your children together maybe, to observe the earth's topography, clouds, and the night city's bright lights etc, from a totally different view; Land on the moon. Move freely. Remember, do not fall into the meteorite impact craters, because some meteor impact craters are several kilometers deep. <br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1346680/extras/2.png?t=1594255343" /><br><br>Lab scene 2: Rover in the Solar system<br><br>We are accustomed to numb life on the earth, chasing fame and fortune. When did we really calm down and look at the world we live in? Let go of your worries, drive your spaceship, travel through the solar system, and explore planets.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1346680/extras/111.png?t=1594255343" /><br><br>Lab scene 3: Travelling around the world on a hot air balloon<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1346680/extras/222.png?t=1594255343" /><br><br>Travel in a hot air balloon, and to see the colorful world, such as:<br>Island castles, volcanic eruptions, city ruins, eastern villages, etc.<br>When you raise your arms(more than 1 meter above the ground),the hot air ballon will move to follow your eye sights,and you can enjoy the view while exercising your arms too.<br><br>We will continue to add more places of interest and release new updates next. Please look forward to it (following will be added for free as soon as August): Stonehenge in the United Kingdom, Eiffel Tower in Paris, New York City, Maldives Seascape, Penguin Island in Antarctica, etc.<br><br>Lab scene 4: Travelling in 80% light speed<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1346680/extras/sprelativity.png?t=1594255343" /><br><br>This is a virtual reality (VR) lab that takes you on a trip in a world with a slow speed of light. This allows for a direct experience of the theory of special relativity, much in the same spirit as in the Mr. Tompkins adventure by George Gamow (1939). We go through the different relativistic effects (e.g. length contraction, time dilation, Doppler shift, light aberration) that show up during the trip - to gain insight and sharpen the intuition on the basic concepts of special relativity.<br><br>I graduated from University of Oxford and started my business endorsed by the University.

Shuffs is a physics-based puzzle game which makes use of platforming controls as a means of hurling projectiles wherever a projectile may need hurling. It's essentially mini-golf, but the kind of mini-golf where you can hit the ball straight into the air, jump up after it and whack it mid-air into the face of a fire-spitting demon.<br />
<br />
This is a game for those who don't feel as though they've earned their victory if said victory was obtained without experiencing the inclination to scream at their computer at least once. The simple core mechanic (walk up to round object, hit round object) is expanded on and diversified over 38 levels, seeing you catapult boulders with crocodile jaws, ride on the webs of spiders as you propel them through the air, or just kick back and play a little keep-up with a balloon in one of the 24 bonus levels you can unlock if you're a good little scarecrow who works their way through the 36 funky stunt shots scattered throughout the farms, swamps and industrial district of Bowkin County.<br />
<br />
The story takes about 2 - 3 hours to complete, and up to an additional 2 hours to achieve the true ending.
Play quick &amp; fun races with your friends. Ride cute animals through dream tracks and abuse 6 unfair bonuses to outrun the hord! Master the dive to avoid obstacles and gain boosts, and explore environments to find hidden shortcuts.<br />

Puzzle in the RETROWAVE style, where you have to solve complex and difficult tasks in order to move the hexagons so that they all fall into the luminous places on the level. Hexagons can move in one direction and move other hexagons, they can not move at all, they can jump over cells, and they can move in two directions at once.

Throw your stone, then it rolls away, and you are forced to move to the point where the stone stops. The rule is so simple, as the same as golf.<br />
<br />
You can practice as many times as you like, using Red Stone. Press Oculus Touch B or Y button to retry.<br />
Be careful when you throw the normal gray stone. If you failed, it rolls away and the next time, you are in an unexpected place. Once you've thrown the gray one, you can not retry.<br />
You can switch between the red one and the gray one by pressing Oculus Touch A or X button.<br />
Regardless of your dominant arm, you can throw it by your either hand.<br />
Showing the Menu is assigned on Oculus Touch Menu button. <br />
This game is a fully auto-save. You cannot save at will, and if you quit the game and then resume it, you will resume from where you were last.<br />
<br />
You're not always just throwing the stone. Sometimes you are required to play just to put it at your feet. Therefore, you need to install a tracking sensor so that you can track down to your feet.<br />
Also, play in a room with high ceilings, as you may be throwing stones high right above you or placing them high up.<br />
And also, this is an obvious one, if you don't want to get injured, play in a tidy and spacious enough room when playing VR games.<br />
You will likely experience real heights in this game, so if you have height phobia, don't play this game. <br />
<br />
Throw the stone, and get the goal above. Good luck!

Thrust Legend is a modern remake of the classic game &quot;Thrust&quot; by Jeremy C. Smith from 1986.  <br><br>Navigate your spaceship through the perilous caverns of increasingly hostile planets. Your mission is to lock-on to the enemy's power pod with your ship's tractor beam and escape the planet's gravity to space. Enemy defenses are automatically activated by your proximity. Enemy defenses are powered by a power station. Shooting the power station will temporarily stun all enemy defenses. Be careful, the power station can only take so much damage. Destroying the power station will cause an explosion, who's blast wave will engulf the entire planet. Escape the planet before the shock-wave destroys you. Use you ship's shield to protect against enemy projectiles and soft impacts with cavern walls. You cannot shoot and use the shield at the same time. Use the ship's fuel extractor above fuel canisters to refuel. If you run out of fuel, it's Game Over. <br><br>Once a planet has been reached, it is unlocked and you can practice or continue playing from this point on later.  Extra bonus points are awarded for destroying power stations. Extra points and achievement stars are awarded for completing the mission under a certain amount of time, fuel and without losing a life.<br>Playing in &quot;Legendary Mode&quot; starts a play-through from the beginning in order to chase a high score.<br><br>This remake contains <br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>6 original levels remastered and juiced!<br></li><li>5 original reverse gravity levels remastered as underwater levels.<br></li><li>6 completely new levels challenging your skills, and if that was not enough,<br></li><li>6 brutal levels originally designed by Martin Burchell in 1992 as a mod of the original BBC-B ROM.<br></li><li>6 underwater ( reverse gravity ) equivalents of the brutal levels.

The Original Soundtrack of VirtuaVerse by MASTER BOOT RECORD
Music made by the developer of Slimey Champions that is in the game.
You drift back from the cold void of the hyper sleep. At first, you only feel a tingling in your mouth and a taste of your blood, but soon all the other symptoms hit you. Your head is exploding. Your stomach is turning. A strange noise rings in your ears. This sound is loud, piercing. An alarm!<br />
<br />
Fighting through dizziness, you open your eyes, the lights of other hibernation chambers blinding you momentarily. Broken glass. Wet floor. A stasis pod burst open like a ripe watermelon, dripping with red. The thing inside was once your friend. Now it barely resembles a human, ripped open from the inside - damage too severe for a simple stasis pod failure. You raise up and check if your other mates are all right. The good news is: they are. You all gather in the middle of the room, shivering, half-naked. The bad news is… plentiful. Ship stuck in the middle of nowhere. Many systems damaged. Bulkheads breached. Unknown contaminants in the air. You also hear noises in the hollow halls of the ship. You’re not alone! To make things worse, you have no idea what happened, and who you can trust, as everyone has their hidden agendas. This would not be the first time a ruthless corporation pits the crew against each other.<br />
<br />
Nemesis: Distress will bring you to a ship lost in space, with Intruders ravaging through the corridors, evolving, and ripping through everything that stands in their way. Will you save the ship? Or take an easier route and board the escape pods?<br />
<br />
Every game of Nemesis will create its own cinematic Sci-Fi horror experience.<br />
<br />
Nemesis: Distress is multi-player focused game with a hidden traitor aspect, as well as shooter and survival elements. Players will play through 40-minute scenarios, trying to fulfill their secret objective and survive.<br />
<br />
Players will choose one of the asymmetric character classes, all with special actions that come in hand in specific situations. They will also select the secret objective they have to fulfill in order to win the game – those are randomly drawn out of the pool containing exciting challenges such as destroying the Nest, directing the ship safely to Mars, or even ensuring other players die. Sometimes there will be no traitor, but you never know who to trust!<br />
<br />
While the implant inside our characters blocks any direct negative interaction (such as shooting other crewmembers), there is plenty of indirect ways to make the lives of other players harder. Setting rooms on fire, spreading false information, closing the doors right in front of their faces is just some of them.<br />
<br />
On top of that, there will be a constant threat of evolving Intruders that slowly take over the ship. While it is possible to kill them, it’s not an easy task, and you get no benefit of it… other than surviving the encounter, that is.<br />
<br />
MAIN FEATURES<br />
·         Hidden traitor mechanism<br />
·         Epic Sci-Fi Horror cinematic feel<br />
·         Advanced, asymmetric multiplayer experience

*This DLC is 100 percent optional and contains absolutely nothing.
A moody puzzle game within a subtle narrative that is itself a puzzle. A little non-linear. A lot experimental. It doesn't hold your hand, yet holds plenty of clues for the observant. Equal parts luck, logic, and trial and error. You decide where your next step will take you. It’s an open field.<br />
<br />
Branching puzzle mechanics create freeform gameplay - each puzzle has multiple solutions that can change your path and alter the ending, giving you an experience that is uniquely your own.<br />
<br />
Small warning: This game is designed to let you take an empty path, get no clues, and still finish. In a way, that’s the point.<br />
<br />
If you want to really dig in, see what you missed, and understand how the game works, there's a New Game Plus mode that tracks your solutions and even unlocks time travel, so you can explore and experiment with new paths without needing to start over again. Solving it all would probably take scribbling notes and strategizing.

<strong>Warning:  Lingering is lovingly crafted to bring forward stories with darker topics such as portrayals of mental health issues, self-harm, mentions of suicide, depictions of hetero/homo sexual acts and violence.

Contained within every burst of feelings is an Ignite, the purest form of energy. Negative feelings bear Lingerings, and positive feelings produce Astrays. Astrays are typically tame, but Lingerings could wreak havoc in the real life while driving its host to madness. However these projected forms pale in comparison to the Ignites. Often unruly and violent, killing an Ignite means killing its host’s ability to feel emotions permanently. <br><br>It is your job to tame the beasts within human hearts.

It is hard to adapt to such drastic changes to our daily lives in a world where most of us need to stay at home to help curb a virus pandemic. Keeping a house organized during quarantine can be difficult, especially when you have some remote work to do too. But don’t freak out. It's all about dividing the household chores between all family members.. When is time for one to work, is time for you to clean. But wait!<br />
<br />
In this all of a sudden hurricane of housework and remote work tasks, the only thing you can do is revisit old hobbies and find joy in the small things. Otherwise, you go insane!<br />
<br />
Let's find joy too in this frenetic shelter simulation game. All you have to do is to take great care of the house, doing all the scheduled household chores in a way that you still have some spare time. Through 10 phases with increasing levels of difficulty, sweep the floor, dust the furniture, put the trash away, do the laundry, and make sure the fridge is always full! But remember, after doing all the chores, you need to dedicate some time to the little joys available in your new routine BEFORE the clock strikes. If you don’t, you go insane, and it’s Game Over.<br />
<br />
It’s really hard to finish all the scheduled chores before the clock strikes. But between each cleared level, let’s find little pleasures in things that have passed unnoticed through your days before.

Follow Elin in her struggle to return to warmth and safety. Somehow stuck in this frozen waste with no knowledge of how she got there, seemingly stuck in an endless loop with no other option than moving forward. You need to help her navigate slippery ice to get back home, all the while trying to stay away from that strange wolf and not collapsing from the cold.<br><br><strong>Please note</strong>, this game is made by a single person on his spare time, if you are looking for a AAA experience, this is not for you.<h2 class="bb_tag"><h2 class="bb_tag">Features</h2></h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>A strange wolf</strong> seems to appear out of nowhere and chase you.

Authentic &amp; original music soundtrack of The House of Da Vinci 2. Dark yet intriguing ambient music, which takes you straight back to Italian Renaissance.<br><br>Our goal was to musically help properly narrate the story and create emotional connection for the player. The real challenge was to create music that feels authentic, doesn't draw too much attention to the player, but can stand on its own. <br> <br><strong>Note from the creator, Tomas Zivor:</strong><br><br>I believe I composed music that feels ambient, yet distinct. I’ve merged contemporary elements, such as pads and synths together with the musical instruments of the Renaissance period (Viola da Gamba, Renaissance Flute etc.). <br><br>I wanted to use the interactive elements of the music for this follow up of successful first game. I’ve created musical layers that became more complex and full, with the advance of the game, creating a musical reward for the player and it also helped to break the repetition of the same music in case the player got &quot;stuck&quot; in the part of the game.<br><br>For the Main Theme, I’ve composed an eerie soundtrack, accompanied by a solo female vocal and solo violin, creating an emotional arc for the whole game.
The music from Hunt the Muglump is now available for download.  All purchasers of Hunt the Muglump will receive the Soundtrack as downloadable content for free.

<h2 class="bb_tag">Vampire: The Masquerade, The Camarilla</h2><strong> Vampire: The Masquerade is the original and ultimate roleplaying game of personal and political horror. You are a vampire, struggling for survival, supremacy, and your own fading humanity--afraid of what you are capable of, and fearful of the inhuman conspiracies that surround you.</strong><br>As a vampire you suffer the pangs of the Hunger, the relentless and terrible thirst for human blood. If you refuse to deal with it, it will overcome your mind and drive you to terrible acts to slake it. You walk this razor's edge every night.<br>Dark designs, bitter enemies, and strange allies await you in this World of Darkness.<br>The global blood opera of the Camarilla story continues. As the eldest vampires begin to vanish, the Ivory Tower starts to crack under the weight of its own decay. Once it was the mightiest faction of vampires in the world, a stronghold of immortality. Now it retreats into a maze of neo-feudal conspiracies to protect itself against the deadly threat of the Second Inquisition, struggling to enforce the Masquerade in the face of modern technology. Featuring insights and perspectives on unlife in the Camarilla from Mark Rein-Hagen and Matthew Dawkins.<br><i> <strong> Mature Warning: contains graphic and written content of a mature nature, including violence, sexual themes, and strong language.

Players will have to dodge swarms of bullets and battle huge bosses as they traverse the 20+ levels of the Infectophage tower. To survive, players will learn to warp around the environment to evade fire, ‘swim’ through the void between safe platforms, pummel enemies with melee attacks and juggle a variety of powerups and combinable weapon pickups.<br><br>VECTORLORD also brings some modern twists to old-school difficulty. Players only have a limited number of lives to complete the game with (run out and it’s Game Over for that save file), and each successive life purchased costs more. Players have a safety net to fall back on, taking inspiration from modern classics like Dark Souls; players can restore lost lives by reclaiming them up from where they fell. As intense as that sounds, VECTORLORD offers multiple difficulty settings, plus options to tone down the neon glow for photosensitive players.

<h2 class="bb_tag">Zombies, medieval combat armor, sharp and pointy weapons... what's not to love? </h2><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1340520/extras/STEAM1.png?t=1594085560" /><br><strong>Chroma</strong> is based in Medieval Europe with one unique twist: the continent is overrun by the undead and you've been tasked with repelling The Horde. You're not the only one on the case though. Other knights, warriors, and ne'er-do-wells are scouring the land looking for a chance to claim the glory of beating back The Horde for themselves. The Old Kingdom is quickly fading into the annals of time, but the combatants that once heralded it's strength are as restless as ever for blood and glory!<br><br><strong><u>Battle your friends in head to head in duels</u></strong><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Duke it out to see which one of your buddies has the greatest grit when it comes to medieval combat. Whether it be sword, spear, bow, or magic, with the right strategy, skill, and a bit of luck, you can come out on top!</li></ul><strong><u>Take on team battles as your try to capture forts from each other </u></strong><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Sitting in a high castle doesn’t always mean safety. Fight alongside your friends and capture the enemy stronghold, demonstrating that your group has the right to rule the roost. </li></ul><strong><u>Outclass your foes by selecting from four varying playstyles </u></strong><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Slay zombies and fellow combatants alike with the classes of Archer, Templar, Inquisitor, or Priest. Ironclad armor, piercing weaponry, skillful arrows, or arcane arts. Your playstyle, your choice!</li></ul><strong><u>Overcome hordes of zombies and struggle for top score</u></strong><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>The unrelenting waves of the undead aren’t the only obstacle you’ll have to overcome in the world of Chroma. Your fellow combatants are sometimes as bloodhungry as the zombies. Wield your weapon of choice well to ensure that you come out on top! </li></ul><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1340520/extras/STEAM2.png?t=1594085560" /><br><strong>Templar:</strong> Physically remarkable warriors famed for their prowess in armed combat that they honed serving The Old Kingdom. While not the brightest, the Templar makes up in brawn what he lacks in brains. Big muscles for big weapons. <br><br><strong>Inquisitor:</strong> Discontented with the existing social order, the outbreak of The Horde served as the perfect pretext for the Inquisitor's emergence from the shadows. Cunning and quick, the Inquisitor can outpace the vast majority of their foes but must be wary of taking excessive physical damage. <br><br><strong>Archer:</strong> Against the slow-moving Horde the Archer leverages distance to their advantage. Bolts and quills send shivers and chills down the spines of their enemies... assuming those spines still have bloodflow. Damage from a distance is still very real damage. <br><br><strong>Priest:</strong> Salvation for the living and damnation for the undead. The Priest class served The Old Kindgom in many critical administrative capacities and reverberate it's existance, using ancient texts to conjure archaic magics. Priests cleanse the land of dark energy, both human and zombie alike.<br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1340520/extras/STEAM3.png?t=1594085560" /><br>Throne Hall, where the last vestiges of the Old Kingdoms echo and their forelorn combatants pit themselves against one another. The Lowland Pasture, where the undead thrive on the rotting corpses of the fallen for as far as the eye can see... and it's your job to thin their ranks. Trial Of Might where you can test your grit against your fellow man as you sharpen your skills and blade to fight the horde, with cavernous hills and mighty walls of stone, with or without one another.

The year is 2866. The planet Mars is 35% terraformed, finally enough to allow the playing of the game of.. Golf!<br />
<br />
Golf across an infinite* rocky Martian surface. Discover golfing obstacles that make us Earthlings gasp in awe!<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
*Infinity is impossible to represent on any non-quantum computer. In actuality there are roughly 25,770,000,000 golf holes in this game.<br />
<br />
In 2020, NASA will launch the Perseverance rover to search for life and golf on Mars. The journey there will take 200 days,<br />
If you were to play one hole of Golf On Mars every 30 seconds during that journey, you would only be able to complete 0.002% of the game (576000 holes).<br />
<br />
If you were a paleolithic hunter-gatherer gazing up at the Red planet one night during your traversal of the ice bridge connecting Russia to Alaska<br />
at the last glacial maximum 24515 years ago and a time traveler brought an iPhone for you and your tribe to ritually play a hole of Golf On Mars every 30 seconds,<br />
it would take until the present day to complete all the holes.<br />
<br />
But this is not a realistic simulation.<br />
<br />
For example, if the ball is 16 pixels wide on your screen then the typical hole will be 1200 pixels away.<br />
Scaling this to the size of a real ball (1.68 inches), it's as if the hole is only 3.5 yards away!<br />
<br />
A realistic 18 hole golf course where the fairways are 3.5 yards away would only require about 1300 square feet of land.<br />
However, gravity on Mars is 38% that of Earth's gravity, so you could hit a ball 7 times farther, or roughly 1400 yards for a good player.<br />
This 18 hole course then needs to be to 64000 square feet. You could cover the entire surface of Mars with 241 billion of these golf courses.<br />
<br />
Therefore, you could easily fit all the holes in Golf On Mars on the surface of Mars.<br />
<br />
Mars is par 3, so aim to finish in under 77 billion strokes.

In Aquascaping you can design and create realistic fish tanks of various scales - small fishbowls, large aquariums, and huge marine exhibits! Fill them with all the kinds of different marine species - angelfish, clownfish, crabs, starfish, sea turtles, or even tiger sharks - if it swims, you can have it!

You can try different configurations and elements, but always remember about the future residents of your fish tank - that means the fish of course! <br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1339000/extras/g3_(1).gif?t=1592571044" /><br><br>When your aquarium is prepared, you can fill it with water and populate with all the manner of marine wildlife. Aquascaping presents you with a very rich variety of both fresh and saltwater creatures to choose from.  But be careful! Different species have different needs and require specific conditions. And if anything goes wrong, you can always try again - no animals will be harmed! <br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1339000/extras/g4.gif?t=1592571044" /><br><br>In Aquascaping you will be able to shape your aquarium the way you like, thanks to a great number of decorative elements.

Dimension Shift is a hardcore game for hardcore gamers. The game constantly shifts between different 2D and 3D views. You have to avoid hitting the obstacles until you reach the end of the level. The game demands all your skill and precision.<br />
<br />
This game follows the principle 'easy to learn, hard to master'. The controls are simple (use either keyboard or controller, jump and steer left/right). But hitting that jump button at exactly the right time - maybe not so much. Make one mistake, and you have to start over. Don't lose hope if you die a lot. With every try you will get a little better. What seems impossible at first, might not be so impossible after all...<br />
<br />
Good luck!

Il était une fois un petit chat qui aimait beaucoup dormir, mais pas n’importe où. Il existait trois lieux dont le félin aimait s’assoupir plus que les autres. Cependant, l’animal n’était pas le seul à convoiter ces endroits. D’étranges créatures les aimaient également. En demeurant pacifiques et franchouillards, ces monstres étaient surtout très insupportables et ne respectaient pas le sommeil du matou. Grâce à de farouches entraînements ainsi que de la persévérance, celui-ci fut capable de maîtriser l'hélicat Jutsu, un art très ancien lui permettant d'utiliser sa queue à la manière d'une hélice, mais cela avait pour effet de provoquer de puissants maux de ventre à notre chat, lui donnant alors une autre faculté hors norme. Ainsi, le combattant moustachu se fut attribué le pittoresque surnom du &quot;Chatpéteur&quot;. Cependant, celui-ci sut jouer de son handicap en l’adaptant face à la situation se trouvant devant lui. Ces accommodations lui permirent d’humilier ces stupides bestioles afin de pouvoir rejoindre le pays des rêve sans dérangement.
<h2 class="bb_tag">Good Mourning – Linear Narrative Redefined</h2> <br>Good Mourning tells a compelling story about rejoice and regrets, redemption and letting go. It’s a tale about good and bad, self-reflection, choices and chances, all the ups and downs of ordinary life, but through a filter of fantasy. <br><br>Good Mourning is a narrative game with high emphasis on replayability. The main storyline consists of hand-crafted elements, which are randomized for every playthrough. The goal is to generate emergent narrative through gameplay, which evolves alongside with the actual story.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1338790/extras/Kapture_2020-06-01_at_9.22.07.gif?t=1593666791" /><br> <br>Following in the footsteps of critically acclaimed Lydia, Good Mourning doesn’t shy away from serious themes, but at the same time it’s also a warm-hearted take on the little things that make everyday life worth living.<br> <br>Just as important as the story itself, is the way it’s presented. Good Mourning is a run-based visual novel, which builds upon playthroughs. Different outcomes portray the story from very different perspectives, which will affect the way the narrative is interpreted. The ultimate ending is covered in the shrouds of mystery, and it’s up to the player to uncover all the facets of the story. During the course of the game the story can evolve to unexpected directions.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1338790/extras/Kapture_2020-06-01_at_9.01.14.gif?t=1593666791" /><br> <br>The structure of Good Mourning is all about breaking the form. Traditional linear narrative is a poor fit for a digital game, for games revolve around choices and interactivity. And as software products games offer a possibility for randomly generated content. This is impossible for other mediums, such as literature and film. We see these factors as possibilities rather than restrictions, and we want to explore how deep this rabbit hole actually is.<h2 class="bb_tag">Gameplay</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Good Mourning combines visual novels into a collection of mini games.</li></ul><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Emphasis is on a story and players are encouraged to experience it through several playthroughs. </li></ul><ul class="bb_ul"><li>The story adapts to the choices players make, and portions of it are randomly selected to ensure replay value.</li></ul><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Replayability is also a key element in the story, as well as the ability to choose and how other people perceive you. Choosing differently has an impact on the story and how it is interpreted.</li></ul><ul class="bb_ul"><li>The interpretation of the story is where the emergent narrative comes to play: the player sees only segments of the storyline, and the bigger picture has to be formed through imagination.</li></ul>
The legendary mage Merlin betrayed by his teammates in the Demon Wars, fall from one of the legendary heroes to a rookie mage, and embarks on a new journey. After all the ups and downs, love and hate, is he confused? Or will he forge ahead and take the journey of light to be the greatest mage in the land of magic? Complete weapon and equipment system, powerful magic system and various ways to use magic scrolls. Welcome to this Japanese open world exploration RPG turn-based game!<br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1338830/extras/q4.png?t=1594943059" /><br>       In addition to the nine characters who join the main team, hundreds of unique NPCs will also appear.Unintended discoveries of treasures can significantly strengthen a character, instead of the traditional upgrade system. The areas of the game are left free to explore from the start. <br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1338830/extras/q2.png?t=1594943059" /><br>        The combat system highlights the differences in resistance to the six types of magic: wind, fire, lightning, ice, light, and darkness. Different demons have different resistances to these six types of magic. The resistance of different demons to spells in the game cannot be directly observed.The various maps in the game are not marked with difficulty levels, while this could be done, the development team felt that it would ruin the authenticity of the game. After all, life is like a box of chocolates; you never know what the next piece will taste like. Furthermore, the weapons that characters from different professions can equip are different, and the vast majority of them have additional effects. <br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1338830/extras/q3.png?t=1594943059" /><br>       What are you waiting for? Come on a journey through this wonderfully magical fantasy world!<br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1338830/extras/q1.png?t=1594943059" />

Created by students of the DigiPen Institute of Technology, this game is built with reaction and mechanical mastery in mind where players are expected to recognize patterns in the scenes and combine movements to advance. Set in a once proud laboratory now broken and neglected, you play as a monster who has broken its containment. Freed of your confinement for the first time in years, you scour the lab in search of an exit, and maybe something more. Something other than freedom that calls to you. <br />
<br />
On your mission to find a way out, you will encounter many dangers. All signs of the previous inhabitants are gone, but the defenses protecting them are as vigilant as ever. However, with your ability to chain dashes together and slow down time, the defenses set up in your way stand no chance. Through sheer force of will and strength beyond normal creatures, you will prove you are what you were designed by your makers long gone to be, an apex predator.<br />
<br />
Features:<br />
-	Chain your dashes to wind through deadly traps.<br />
-	Slow down time and enjoy the view of your beautiful prison.<br />
-	Time yourself, challenge your friends, beat the developers!

Countless storms, hurricanes and whirlwinds were accompanied by bizarre noxious rain.  All of a sudden, each and every living thing began to dwindle and wane, while the sky dimmed ominously. The vegetation faltered and decayed as rivers, lakes and oceans dried up at a frightening pace. The animals, deprived of their food, began attacking each other. The spirits that used to look after the planet, and had once radiated warmth and light, have now gone into hiding or otherwise disappeared.<br><br>The inhabitants of Aryasan have also been tainted by Chaos. Various physical and mental ailments, fear, unavailability of resources, and no sense of security impacted the tribes in a catastrophic way. Mutual trust eroded, and was replaced by hostility and aggression. Constantly erupting conflicts and disputes quickly turned into open war. Since then the lands of Aryasan yielded no crops and the water reservoirs remained dry. It would seem that all signs of life have disappeared from the surface of the planet… but has magic?<br><br>Since time immemorial, there existed mysterious subterranean structures in the heart of Aryasan. Many terrifying legends have been told about this place and no one dared enter them for fear of discovering the truth behind these stories. It was said to be the birthplace of magic; the good kind - the magic which awakened the life of the beautiful planet, and the evil kind - the magic which spawned powerful underground creatures protecting these mysterious caves and underground passages at all costs. The legend has it that magical stones can be found there and that they alone can bring life back to Aryasan.<br><br>Though it might seem that magic has lost most of its power on the planet’s surface, I still believe it is not gone completely. Why? Because despite its waning power it managed to preserve a life… my life. My name is Eremit. Why am I here?. Am I the last of my kind? Will I be able to find others? Those things I do not know. But I have been chosen for a quest of utmost importance - that much I know for certain. It is time I embarked on it and revealed my entire story to you…<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1338490/extras/more_soon_stay_tuned.png?t=1594905681" />

<strong>“That’s not how I remember it.”</strong><br><br>New York City, New Year's Eve 1999. An unlikely team of four professional cleaners for the mob gathers to drink and reminisce about their careers at the turn of the millenium. As the details of their stories stop matching up, the ugly truth behind their cooperation begins to reveal itself. What starts as a celebration of a decade of shared history slowly turns into a tense and dangerous standoff.<br><br><strong>Meet them at a very strange time in their lives.</strong><br><br>An homage to 90s cinema - from Tarantino’s classics through cult crime thrillers to B-movie action favorites and more - <strong>Serial Cleaners</strong> remixes those familiar places, characters and scenes into its own unique spin on a decade full of brightly colored optimism... and the grime underneath it all. Our rich soundtrack is composed of many genres that defined the end of the 20th century, from East Coast hip hop to industrial metal and rave. Doesn’t matter if the sound of “your” nineties was defined by the clubs, the festivals, or the radio - we’ve got you covered.<br><br><strong>Move without sound. Clean without emotion. Disappear without trace.</strong><br><br>Four characters, four perspectives, four play styles. Street smarts, brute force, cutting-edge tech skills or good old fashioned tricks of the trade: each will allow you to tackle a similar obstacle much differently. Choose your path through the non-linear story by picking the part of the narrative you want to hear next, and then approach each mission as carefully or brazenly as you like. Utilize stealth, exploration and speed as the situation - and your preferred experience - warrants it. Get rid of the bodies and other damning evidence to wipe the decade's slate clean before the new millenium comes!

It turned out that the virus came to earth together with a meteorite that fell in the South-West of China in the province of Yunnan. The virus took a year and a half of mutations to adapt to the realities of our planet. Vaccine development has produced results, but no cure. To get a healing vaccine, scientists need the genotype of the original virus, before it mutates on our earth. A group of volunteers was sent into space, to a previously unknown planet, where the meteorite supposedly appeared, in search of material for the coveted vaccine.</i><br><u><strong>Description of gameplay:</strong></u><br><i>Survive on an unknown planet in 2D format, kill or bypass enemies.

Future updates to this course will allow learners to go beyond setup to practice additional skills. Step into a virtual laboratory and learn how to work safely in the first-ever Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) virtual reality (VR) laboratory training course.  <br>This course is developed for laboratory professionals and supplements the existing CDC eLearning course on the same topic found on the CDC LabTraining page.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>COMING SOON:</strong></h2>CDC is developing additional components of this course, such as:<br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>How to cleanup spills<br></li><li>How to do general work<br></li><li>Safely remove materials<br></li><li>Proper decontamination and shutdown <br></li><li>Emergency shutdown procedures</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>OBJECTIVES:</strong></h2>After completing this course, learners will be able to:<br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Identify the major parts of a Class II BSC<br></li><li>Demonstrate how to maintain positive airflow within a BSC<br></li><li>Demonstrate how to prepare for work in a BSC</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>AUDIENCE:</strong></h2>This course is designed for public health and clinical laboratory staff, safety professionals, and persons interested in the safe use of biological safety cabinets.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong></h2>Biological Safety Cabinets (BSCs) are enclosed, ventilated workspaces designed for safely working with pathogens, contaminants, and other potentially hazardous materials. A BSC is a primary engineering control used to keep laboratory professionals safe by providing a physical barrier and an environmental barrier against biohazardous or infectious agents. The BSC helps maintain quality control of the material being worked with as it filters both the inflow and exhaust air.<br>CDC chose biosafety cabinets as its first VR training topic because the proper use of a BSC is a critical laboratory safety issue. The misuse of BSCs has contributed to laboratory safety incidents across the country and internationally. Also, the current BSC eLearning course has a consistently high participation rate and has received positive feedback from learners. With  VR technology added to the existing eLearning course, learners can be trained on how to use a BSC properly without exposure to pathogens or risk of accidental infection or accidental release.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>VR NOTE: </strong></h2>This VR course requires a play area of at least 3ft x 3ft, but ideally a larger 20 ft x 20ft space to make the experience feel more accurate and real.  This VR course also requires a play area with 360° tracking. Currently, this course is designed to work ONLY on the HTC Vive VR platform.

The game action takes place in a medieval fantasy setting. The players get to develop their starting town with resources collected from the nearby lands, to raise increasingly powerful armies which they use to advance their conquest.<br><br><strong><u>Starting conditions</u></strong><br><br>The player begins as a lord of a small castle on a remote island. With the help of a few poorly armed fighting men, or by itself, it battles bandits and monsters, to collect resources and help the people of the island.<br><br><strong><u>Castle Building</u></strong><br><br>The castle building happens in steps, called seasons. Each season, the player gets to organize and manage the town with all economic actions taking effect at the end of each season. Season length varies based on kingdom size, with larger kingdoms having longer seasons.<br><br><strong><u>Armies</u></strong><br><br>The player builds weapons in the castle. These weapons can be equipped on soldiers trained in the barracks. It is the equipment given to the soldier that defines it's abilities. Soldiers can wear 5 different pieces of armor and use 1 weapon in each hand. The number of items available to the player, which is initially low, grows fast forcing the player to balance the increased weapon costs with the cost of recruiting more soldiers.<br><br><strong><u>Exploration</u></strong><br><br>The player commands armies lead by lords. Initially, only one army can be moved around, on a grid based map. Moving the army reveals more territory with new challenges and opportunities.<br>The large maps contain quest givers which offer missions taking place in smaller areas. These areas are otherwise hidden. Completing quests allows the player to advance deeper into the world.<br><br><strong><u>Combat</u></strong><br><br>The combat happens on a hex grid, with the units involved taking turns to act based on their speed.<br><br><strong><u>Progress</u></strong><br><br>There are two aspects of progress in the game.<br>One is the economic progress. Developing a castle, and later on conquering other castles and developing those, will advance the kingdom technology allowing the player to get its hands on more powerful equipment, or in larger quantities.<br>The second one is the advancement of each army commander, the lords, by gaining experience. Experience is used to train skills that improve the battle abilities of an army, either by allowing a more numerous and specialized force, or by boosting the individual soldiers strength.<br><br><strong><u>Player vs Player interaction</u></strong><br><br>For the first few steps a new player makes, there is no pressure from other players. The first castle the player owns acts as a sanctuary which cannot be touched by others. As the player progresses, it can choose to get more involved with other players, by running missions on islands accessible by everyone.<br>Eventually, player conflict becomes inevitable.<br>Players will find each other on the map and may choose to attack. The engagements happen either directly, by two armies meeting, indirectly, when an army is inside a mission area and the other one finds it, or with an army attacking a player owned castle.<br><br><strong><u>Objectives</u></strong><br><br>The game does not have an ending. The objective of each player is to hold the most advanced castle it can for as long as it can.

Set in Canada's frozen boreal forest 'The Cabin' is a 2D Survival Game where you must balance resource management, combat and exploration to survive the harsh winter and battle against the mysterious 'Augs' who've caused you to flee here.<br />
<br />
Initially you'll spawn with nothing but an ax outside of the cold, unstocked Cabin. You'll need to gather firewood to heat it up, this can be done by navigating to a tree and clicking on it to swing your ax. Once you've collected the wood return to the cabin and heat it up by clicking inside to deposit the wood. Once you've heated the cabin up and regained your energy your next priority should be retrieving the handgun you dropped while fleeing here. It'll be around the cabin. <br />
<br />
Running and gunning is no sensible way of combating the mysterious 'Augs', you'll need to stand still to properly shoot them. Press 'A' to toggle in and out of attack mode and click where you wish to fire. If you run out of ammo you'll need to loot the local cabins for supplies, otherwise your only means of defense will be firebombs constructed from wood and gas.<br />
<br />
The Moose are harmless to yourself but can trample trees and destroy good sources of wood and lumber. A handgun stands no chance of dropping them, you'll need to grapple with them gouging with the ax or find your neighbors shotgun. Finally there are the wolves, who generally will leave you be. That is until they hunt the moose population in your region to extinction. Handguns are useless, they are too fast and can withstand several shots. The neighbors shotgun is the only way of killing these beasts.

It's complicated. It all started with a visual novel and ended up with the fact that we dropped SVA in a VAT with other games.

As the result: SVA became visual casual-hardcore adventure novel from the first person with elements of survival and catching kakemono for RPG-elements with a slight touch of scrolling shooter and a simulator feeding the pigeons.

In addition, it provides all-new options like the <strong> avatar of evil</strong> family of feats that bring an evil cleric one step closer to dreadful divinity, variant channeling feats to enrich an evil cleric's bag of supernatural tricks, and the Craft Cursed Item feat gives mischievous clerics a new way to torment their victims. Finally, this book contains a collection of malicious magic items like the <i> altar of binding</i> and <i> phylactery of heresy</i> , some to augment the armamentarium of an evil apostle and others to bedevil those who would stand in her way, along with a pair of perilous priestly tomes replete with dark secrets, sinister spells, and other nefarious new options to make your cultists and clerics truly memorable foes.<br>Grab this testament to the power of the dark side of divinity, and as if evil clerics weren't enough you can make your most malevolent masters of evil even more marvelous with the companion books <strong> <i>Legendary Villains: Antipaladins</i> </strong> and <strong> <i>Legendary Villains: Dark Druids!</i> </strong> It's time to <strong> Make Your Villains Legendary!</strong> (Note: some of these are not yet available on Fantasy Grounds)<br> <i>Converted by:</i>   <strong>Connor Bates</strong> <br> <br> <strong>Requires:</strong> An active subscription or a one time purchase of a Fantasy Grounds Full or Ultimate license and the included Pathfinder ruleset.

<strong>Rolling Arcade</strong> is a digital reimagining of a classic mechanical arcade game, where your objective is to steer a small metal ball into the correct holes. Turning from analogue to digital, the game keeps all the tension of the original but adds new levels and new game modes.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1334330/extras/balltrail.gif?t=1591789952" /><h2 class="bb_tag">Score Attack</h2><br>The ultimate goal of <strong>Rolling Arcade</strong> is to score as many points as you can on each level. The faster you steer the ball to the targets, the bigger the reward will be. Reaching a high enough score will unlock new levels and put you on the online leaderboard.<h2 class="bb_tag">Three Game Modes</h2><br>Excitement, fun (and sometimes tears) await you in all three game modes of <strong>Rolling Arcade</strong>:<br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Standard – The original mode of the game. You have three balls to reach the final target on each level. Don’t waste too much time though since you are racing against the clock.<br></li><li>Endless – Just lay back, you don’t have a timer here. But you only have one ball, so take care of it. How many points can you score this way?<br></li><li>Two Players – Get a friend of yours into the game in this local multiplayer mode. Compete with each other and see who can score more points!</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">Message from the Developer</h2><br>Welcome to my third game, I hope you will find enjoyment in <strong>Rolling Arcade</strong>. Since my previous work took almost three years to make, I needed a tiny project to avoid burnout, this is how this game came to life. Please don’t expect some super serious and complicated game this time. <strong>Rolling Arcade</strong> is a small timewaster, which you can play for a few minutes when you don’t know what to play, or you are waiting for a download. Since it is a small game, I tried to price it accordingly, I hope you will find it fair.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1334330/extras/coop_gif.gif?t=1591789952" />

<h2 class="bb_tag">Rumours, Notes and Books Collection</h2>This is a collection of four different modules that add rumours, notes and books to your 5th Edition game. Each of the four modules is detailed more thoroughly below.<br><strong> 100 Dungeon Myths, Legends and Rumours</strong><br>Characters may often explore dungeons, but they may also need a reason to head to them in the first place. Such a reason can come from asking around and discovering myths and legends about the dungeon in question. This supplement has 100 different rumours that characters could discover about a dungeon. They can be rumours of lost adventurers and treasures, deadly monsters and dungeon peculiarities. Whether or not any specific rumour is true is up to the GameMaster. The provided rumours can be used as lures, background flavour or as potential adventure hooks.<br><i>Here are some sample results:</i><br>The dungeon was once above ground, a vast stone castle of illogical construction. Over the years, the castle sank gradually into the ground, becoming the present-day dungeon. Sages say that the castle didn't sank because the ground gave way beneath it, but because of the sheer evil of its inhabitants. Over the years, the evil actions carried out in the castle soaked into the stone, weighing it down just as a soul would be weighed down. The earth could no longer support such a concentration of evil and gave way beneath it.<br>The entire dungeon was built with a single purpose in mind, to guard a powerful artefact that is hidden deep within. The artefact is too powerful to be used, and doing so would create great devastation. It has therefore been hidden away from any hands that might be foolish enough to use it, with chambers, guards, traps and tricks emplaced to prevent anyone from finding the artefact again. It's rumoured that the last time the artefact was used, an entire realm sunk below the waters.<br>The Fellowship of the Nine Flails went deep into the dungeon but only one of the party returned, weeks later, badly injured and completely, incurably mad. The, presumably sole survivor, died shortly after returning to the surface, despite the aid he was given. During that time, he was constantly babbling about things coming out of the walls and attacking his party.<br>The great dragon Felurivaax terrorised the lands for years before he retreated underground with his treasure. His hoard is vast, fruit of the scouring of dozens of cities. Felurivaax has not been seen since he went underground and many think he is now dead, his treasure unguarded. Others say that the dragon sleeps, dreaming, on his hoard, and if any treasure seekers disturb his rest, he will awaken to plague the surface world once more.<br>The legendary paladin Sir Arabal Demonsbane descended into the dungeon to seek out a mighty demon that lurked within. Sir Arabal was never seen again, but neither was the demon. It is believed that both slew the other. Sir Arabal had his famed sword with him, the Demonsbane after which he was called, and that never surfaced again either. The sword probably still lies deep below ground, waiting for a new wielder to carry it into battle against demons.<br><strong> 100 Irrelevant Notes and Letters to Bamboozle Players</strong><br>Players will often come across various notes and letters that are important and useful to whatever quest they are pursuing. However, if only important notes are detailed, it becomes pretty clear which ones are relevant.<br>Here, then, are 100 different notes, letters, demands, lists, reports, threats, evidence of conspiracies or the ravings of madmen that all look like they might be important, but have no actual meaning - unless, of course, the GameMaster decides otherwise. These can be used to answer the question, &quot;What do we find?&quot; with some misleading answers. Alternatively, they could be used as a source of adventure hooks or ideas.<br>There are two tables. The main one is the list of actual notes and there is a supplementary one that gives 12 different conditions for the notes to be found in (a thirteenth is naturally neither damaged nor unusual).<br>Most of the notes are suitable for any setting, including modern and futuristic. Some may need tweaking to remove references to magic or supernatural creatures. Names and places can be added or changed to be more relevant to a setting or adventure.<br><i>Here are some sample results:</i><br>Progress requires sacrifice. Sacrifice is all. Either willing or unwilling, sacrifices must be made.<br>Ratface, spy on me again and when I get my hands on you, your eyes won't be the only orbs that I'll remove from your pustulent body. Get my drift?<br>Reach inside and feel for the hidden catch on the right. The top will then open. Reach inside the top, but only by an inch, and feel for the knothole. Depress that before proceeding, unless you want to lose a hand. Once done, reach down until you find the item and then withdraw it.<br>Rotate the wheel counter clockwise for half a turn. Press it in two inches, then pull it out three. Rotate it clockwise for three quarters of a turn. It will then open.<br>Sharra, I know that you love the look and smell of fresh flowers, but can you please not bring them in? I have no objection to colourful or fragrant items, but please, not ones that I am allergic to! I haven't been able to stop sneezing all day and my eyes are constantly watering. It makes it impossible for me to get any work done. Deran.<br><strong> 100 Less Than Useful Books to Find on a Fantasy Bookshelf</strong><br>This is a supplement intended to flesh out the bookshelves of a fantasy setting. Players will come across books in different places - libraries, wizard's lairs, in the possession of sages - and some of them may be useful and valuable. But what about the others?<br>This is a list of 100 different, not exactly useful, low worth books that can be used to answer players' questions about what books they find. Each has the title, author and an overview of the, generally useless, contents, together with their weight and low value in GP. Both fiction and non-fiction books are listed.<br><i>Here are some sample results:</i><br>Lost Lands of the Desert by Cuthbert Diggerly (Non-fiction, a not entirely accurate investigation into legends about civilisations now buried beneath the sands)<br>Modern Magic by Thalmus the Wise (Non-fiction, a theoretical book on how spell casting has evolved over the years into its modern style, largely incomprehensible to most)<br>Necromancy: The Misunderstood Art by Raknard Drakfor (Non-fiction, an essay on the good uses of necromancy and how its practice can be beneficial)<br>Official Charter of the Guild of Wainwrights by Guildmaster Thorp (Non-fiction, full of legalese on topics such as how apprentices are trained, the different levels of membership and how to become a master)<br>One Last Gasp by Letise Trill (Fiction, a murder mystery about an undead assassin)<br><strong> 100 Rumours to Hear in a Town or Village</strong><br>Players will often ask around in towns and villages trying to find out useful information. This lists 100 different rumours for them to hear.<br>The rumours are aimed at a fantasy setting and are most suited to towns and villages rather than cities, as the last tends to focus more on urban events, but some can still be used in such a setting.<br>The rumours may or may not be true, at the GM's decision. They can simply be used as background flavour to make a setting seem more alive, to hide important information amongst the dross or perhaps as adventure hooks themselves, if they are fleshed out.<br><i>Here are some sample results:</i><br>There's been a spate of thefts in town recently. Some blame that dodgy looking group who passed through a few days ago. Personally, I think one of those thieves' guilds has decided to set up shop here.<br>There's one odd oak in the nearby woods. Something just doesn't look right about it but you can't tell what. Standing under its shadow makes a shiver run down your spine though.<br>The village well? Yes, it looks a bit strange, all polished brass and moving parts, but the water is always fresh. No-one seems to know who created it though. Dwarves, I reckon. Or perhaps gnomes, they're fond of odd mechanical things.<br>The serving wenches at the tavern are open to a bit of afterhours serving, if you have the coin. If you know what I mean.<br>Tonas claims he saw a group of orcs in the woods to the east. I hope they aren't planning a raid.<br> <i>Converted by:</i>   <strong>Adrian Kennelly</strong> <br> <br> <strong>Requires:</strong> An active subscription or a one time purchase of a Fantasy Grounds Full or Ultimate license and the included 5E Compatible ruleset.

<h2 class="bb_tag">Reach Adventure 4: Last Flight of the Amuar</h2>In Reach Adventure 4: Last Flight of the Amuar, a Leviathan-class merchant cruiser was engaged in an exploratory trade cruise into the so-called Outrim Void, a region of sparse star systems just over the border from Imperial space. Long-range merchant cruisers were built for regions like this, and have been successful. However, there have been losses too. Among them was the Amuar, which 'went Outrim' as the saying goes. She is long overdue, presumed lost, and has not been located by a search of the trans-border worlds.<br>The Travellers are engaged by a relative of one of Amuar's crew, who has an idea of where she might have been headed. What was the fate of the Amuar and her crew, and can either be recovered?<br>This adventure takes place in Egryn and Pax Rulin subsectors of the Trojan Reach sector, and would make an excellent introduction to this region's many adventuring possibilities. Almost any group of Travellers will be suitable for this adventure, though they will need to be able to operate their starship or have suitable crew available to do it for them.<br>Reach Adventure 4: Last Flight of the Amuar contains background information on the Senlis Foederate and Belgardian Sojurnate, both pocket empires within the Trojan Reach, along with a detailed view of Leviathan-class merchant cruisers, and the Lancer-class corvette.<br> <i>Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by:</i> <strong>Colin Richardson</strong> <br> <br> <strong>Requires:</strong> An active subscription or a one time purchase of a Fantasy Grounds Full or Ultimate license and a one time purchase of the Traveller 2E (Mongoose) ruleset.

You are a lowly gnome (or mech-gnome) that needs to gather 1 million shinnies to prove your worth and graduate from the Gnomish Inventor's Institute. You craft silly things, like gadgets and gizmos and then sell those crafts for shinnies. But the task is grueling, and so you must make machines from those silly parts to help you craft more gadgets and gizmos more quickly and efficiently. However, machines break down and need repaired, and the machines don't work the way you might expect. Work your way through the objectives, to generate 1 million shinnies and graduate from the Inventor's Institute.<br><br><strong>Crafting - </strong> You begin with a small assortment of various parts and use the three crafting bins to combine those parts into more complicated parts. However, the more complicated the part, the more its worth in <strong>shinnies</strong>. But don't be fooled, the crafting gets harder and more involved as you unlock more recipes.<br><br><strong>Machines - </strong> As you advance through the objectives which guide you through the game, you will be able to build machines which craft parts for you. You will need to use your <strong>shinnies</strong> to buy the blueprints in the shop, then craft the parts to build the machine. Once built though, machines are partial to breaking down and will need periodic maintenance. Machines can be upgraded to improve their output and efficiency.<br><br><strong>Resource Management - </strong> To be successful and graduate the Institute, you must carefully balance your parts, <strong>shinnies</strong> and machines. Only widgets and subsequent parts can be sold in the shop. So if you don't have the parts to craft widgets and no shinnies to buy parts, you might fail. Machines have a tendency to over-produce one part or another, consuming valuable resources. If your machines get out of hand, you might fail. <br><br><strong>Shop - </strong> The game's shop provide three categories, trade parts for <strong>shinnies</strong>, <strong>shinnies</strong> for parts and upgrade machines and materials. You can even upgrade the materials used for your parts, like Iron, Steel and Titanium, to get more <strong>shinnies</strong> per part. Careful planning and knowledge of the store's components is key to success.<h2 class="bb_tag">About the Author</h2>I am a teacher of 14 years and have always wanted to publish my own game.

What the King of Trem did not know is that Tazven was the sinister Sorcerer Leartnom's only son. The Sorcerer, of the opposing mountain kingdom village of Yekrut, hidden between the Serpent Sea and the dark pine trees of Adanac, vowed to take revenge on the King for his grave mistake of slaying his son—which could not be forgiven—even in battle.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1333340/extras/level_02_01_0-2_short.gif?t=1594286276" /><br><br>In vengeance, Sorcerer Leartnom cursed King Trem's only child—a raven-haired daughter, Princess Julia. The curse imprisoned her in the castle dungeon with a power so great that her lungs would be pierced with shards of metal should she dare step outside of her cell. Once the king came to visit his daughter and deceptively attempted to remove his daughter from the dungeon by means of a hidden spiral staircase that was only known to the servants. But soon he found that his daughter’s breath was sucked from her lips with such sharp pain that her screams echoed in the guard’s armored helmets. Condemned to the cavernous halls of the castle’s bowls, Princess Julia was never to see daylight again until the curse was broken.<br><br>The King promised to give his throne to any man who could save his daughter from this dreadful fate of imprisonment just beneath his own feet in the castle dungeon on the Isle of Trem. Many soldiers and adventurers failed trying to save Princess Julia.<br><br>Until one day, after a terrible storm in the Serpent Sea, the Pirate Magician Yapla found himself washed up on the island Kingdom of Trem. He was the sole survivor of his shipwreck. The Pirate Magician Yapla realized that the only way out off of the island was to open the massive castle drawbridge with the wizard wand which was hidden by Sorcerer Leartnom in Princess Julia’s cell. Further intrigued by the prospect of being king, the Pirate Yapla embarked on an adventure through the castle's dungeons to save himself and the cursed Princess Julia.

Why is it called &quot;Bring Dad Home&quot;?<br>Because the game was inspired by my real experience.<br>It was at the beginning of 2019, a dark night on a high month, and my dad just participated in socializing and drank too much. After getting out of the car, what only I can do is helping him walking home.<br>I'm not strong, but dad had a huge body.<br>It was okay at first, but gradually became physically weak and unable to help him later. My dad fell and got injured. He was taken to the hospital immediately by me.<br>A few days later, our team participated in the 2019 Global 48-Hour Extreme Development Competition, and we got a question about family relationships-&quot;What does home mean to you?&quot;<br>So, we hit it off right away, and &quot;Bring Dad Home&quot; was born.<br>After 48 hours, we won the &quot;Most Popular Game Award&quot; in Guangzhou.<br>At the end of 2019, &quot;Bring Dad Home&quot; was selected for the Indie Prize finals.<br>We hope that this game will not only bring joy to everyone, but also remind you of some interesting memories with your loved ones.<br><br><strong>The cool feeling of attacking:</strong><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1332380/extras/s9.gif?t=1595399617" /><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1332380/extras/s3.gif?t=1595399617" /><br><br><br><strong>Extremely game difficulty :</strong><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1332380/extras/s13.gif?t=1595399617" /><br><br><strong>Various Characters:</strong><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1332380/extras/s1.gif?t=1595399617" /><br><br><strong>A variety of equipment and props are waiting for you to unlock:</strong><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1332380/extras/s8.gif?t=1595399617" /><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1332380/extras/s10.gif?t=1595399617" /><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1332380/extras/s11.gif?t=1595399617" />

Source Wars is a fast-paced arcade RTS with base-building, resource management and territorial conquest, set in a cyberpunk universe. Battles are fought in holodeck arenas that are divided into sectors. Each sector has it's own mainframe temple, which can be hacked to take over the sector. The game is won, once all sectors are hacked and all enemy units destroyed.<br />
<br />
The game is currently in early development and in the current version you can play against up to 7 AIs for territorial domination. Each player starts with one sector and units are spawned automatically at the mainframe temple of that sector at regular intervals. Enemy sectors are captured by standing next to the mainframe temple of those sectors with at least 1.5 times as many units as any of the opponents have standing there. Winning conditions are the conquest of all enemy sectors as well as the destruction of all enemy units.<br />

The Yak-9 was the first model in the most mass-produced family of the WWII Soviet fighters - with its many modifications the total amount of units produced reached 16,769. The work on the new long-range recon and fighter plane began in the Yakovlev design bureau during Spring 1942 and it resulted in the creation of Yak-7DI, which was adopted by the VVS as early as August 6th of that same year under the designation Yak-9. The new model had a boosted M-105PF engine, a lighter wing of composite structure, and the lower spine with a bubble canopy that significantly improved the rearward visibility. In comparison to the earlier Yak-7b, the armament was reduced to one nose-mounted 12.7mm UBS MG and one 20mm SHVAK engine-mounted cannon firing through the propeller hub.<br><br>The mass production of the new fighter and its arrival to the frontline units begun only in 1943. In combat, the Yak-9 proved itself as very maneuverable and easy to control fighter, earning the love and respect of many Soviet pilots along with volunteer French from the Normandie Niemen fighter regiment.<br><br>In addition to Quick Mission Builder and Multiplayer modes, you can fly it in Career mode during <strong>Battle of Kuban</strong> timeframe.<br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Armament: 20mm gun &quot;ShVAK&quot;, 120 rounds, 800 rounds per minute and 12.7mm machine gun &quot;UB&quot;, 200 rounds, 1000 rounds per minute.<br></li><li>Length: 8.5 m<br></li><li>Wingspan: 10 m<br></li><li>Wing surface: 17.15 m²</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">Modifications</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Landing light for night flights (2 kg weight increase, minor speed loss).<br></li><li>Fixed loop radio compass RPK-10 (10 kg weight increase, minor speed loss).<br></li><li>PBP-1A reflector gunsight (0.5 kg weight increase).<br></li><li>Rearview mirror (1 kg weight increase).</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">Skins</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Standard paint scheme.<br></li><li>Lt.-Col.

One of the first models of the Yak-9 family was Yak-9T (&quot;tank&quot;), that appeared in early 1943. In addition to one 12.7mm UBS MG it was armed with a 37mm engine-mounted cannon model 11P (later NS-37) instead of a 20mm SHVAK. The installation of such a heavy and large weapon required reinforcing the airframe in the nose section and moving the pilot cabin 40 cm (1.31 ft.) rearward, which resulted in worse forward and underside visibility.<br><br>Frontline trials were conducted from July 5th till August 26th, 1943 on Central, Bryansk and Western Soviet Fronts.

A classic side-scrolling shoot´em up returns in a new look. Powered by the Unreal Engine, this 2.5D action scroller puts you in control of the IAV, the first interstellar attack vessel built by humans. The human race is under attack. A huge alien vessel is approaching our solar system fast and you need to stand against them. Fight the aliens in ten unique levels, get deeper into the alien ship and find out what drives the alien forces from within. Active abilities, such as time dilation (bullet-mode), cloak and homing missiles help to defeat even the cruelest enemies. Research new alien technology and improve your ship to get ready for bigger and stronger enemies. Once you defeat the final enemy, play again on a harder difficulty... new technology and more enemies await on each replay.<br><br><strong>Active Abilities</strong><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Slow down time with the time dilation device.

Save the town of Riverside from starvation by building and maintaining a farm. Work the barren soil, breed new types of crops, and build automated systems to help manage the land.

WEBCUP SOCCER is an <strong>arcade soccer game</strong> with <strong>old-school gameplay, fast-paced graphics, responsive controls, accurate ball physics</strong> and <strong>online multiplayer</strong>.<h2 class="bb_tag">Features / Roadmap</h2><h2 class="bb_tag">Fast-paced Gameplay</h2>WCS is not a simulation but an arcade “easy to learn, hard to master” approach to playing soccer on a computer. When designing WCS, it is crucial to me that controls always feel utmost responsive, and that you would never have to wait for any animation/script to finish before your desired action commences.<h2 class="bb_tag">Responsive Controls</h2>All your beautiful dribblings, passes and goals should be a direct result of you controlling the game, pressing the right buttons at the right time and for the correct amount of time, rather than random effects or pre-scripted events.<h2 class="bb_tag">“Easy to Learn, Hard to Master”</h2>Simulating the complex player movements, feints, tricks, dribblings and kicks, which are part of real-life soccer, leads to very complex controller layouts with lots of buttons to use and dozens of combinations which are hard to master, requiring a lot of practice and making soccer simulations quite hard to pick up.<br><br>WCS is different. I won’t even try to simulate the complexity of the Beautiful Game. Rather, I concentrate on the bare essentials: dribbling, passing and kicking. That’s why WCS only uses (about) 3 buttons and one stick.<h2 class="bb_tag">Realistic Ball Physics</h2>The ball being the central piece of the game, it actually was the very first thing I started to implement years ago. It’s essential to me to have authentic, plausible and smooth ball physics, as a backbone of exiting, controllable and fun gameplay.<h2 class="bb_tag">Strong Ai</h2>A powerful and challenging AI is crucible for single player matches or co-op matches against a CPU-controlled team. As the goalies (for now) are always CPU-controlled, their AI code is especially important to me: Not only have I been a keeper myself in my youth, a strong and plausible goalie behavior is crucial in matches of human players against each other: It’s very frustrating if one’s goalie concedes a goal in a buggy, implausible way — so that’s something I try hard to avoid.<h2 class="bb_tag">Online Multiplayer</h2>Playing WCS over the net is a core part of its design. (Actually, online play was the reason for me to rewrite huge parts of Natural Soccer, which lead to the base code of WCS). While, in the beginning, WCS will just offer online play of two players against each other, my goal is to add various additional modes, such as playing with up to 8 (or even 20?) players in any vs/co-op combinations, or join a match as a spectator only.<h2 class="bb_tag">Playing either Any Player Or At Fixed Positions</h2>Usually, when choosing to control a team you control any player on the pitch and switch control to the closest to the ball. My goal is to offer the option to rather play in a fixed position or “line”. So, for example, you could choose to only control your team’s center striker, without switching - a control scheme (AFAIK) introduced with “Kick Off Player Manager” and today known as “Become a legend”. Another idea is to build on this idea and offer a “semi-fixed” control scheme: Rather than fixing control to one single position, you may choose to control only the DEF, MID or ATT line of your team. This is especially useful when playing with another player cooperatively in the same team: One may choose to play the attacking line while the other is responsible for the defense - much like a foosball table. Mixing and matching all those modes with online play should make for some exciting matches!<h2 class="bb_tag">Online Community</h2>Accompanying the online play, I plan to create an online community website to find players to play against, create and schedule online leagues/tournaments or cooperatively create and edit team/player databases. I am also toying with the idea to (live) stream online matches to spectators all around the world.<br><br><br><strong>I really hope to create a fun, worth-to-play online arcade soccer game with that old-school vibe!</strong>

<h2 class="bb_tag">Legend of the world Phantor</h2><strong> VR King of Battle Cards </strong> - Fantasy-style card game that will immerse you in the history of the world of Phantor.. The evil and cruel King Revelant captured this world. Take part in the battles for the liberation of the land, as part of the Union of Kings. Gather your army, learn the intricacies of using combat cards, increase the level of troops and defeat Revelant in an epic battle, bringing peace to the lands of Phantor. Experiment with a card and collect the battle deck that is right for you. In each card, the Archmage Nyriton enclosed the spirit of a warrior or magic with its own characteristics, by knowing which you can improve their strengths or weaknesses. Before you fight in the battle with Revelant, you must defeat his no less powerful allies, capturing their souls and enclosing them in cards. At the same time, Revelant’s allies are not idle and can challenge you to battle at any time using the “Black Mark” in an attempt to ruin your castle ... <br><strong><i>The full version of the Legends of the world Phantor you will find in the book &quot;History&quot; on the main table in his castle in the game.</i></strong><h2 class="bb_tag"> The mechanics of the game </h2> In the game, you appear in the throne room of your castle, in which, moving between tables, you can set up your battle deck, buy new cards and improve existing cards for coins received from victory in battles.<br>In battle, you appear on the tower of your castle. Pick up cards and throw them on the battlefield. At the place where the map falls, a warrior appears who will go to attack the enemy tower or the nearest enemy. From the power of the throw depends range of flight the card. The further the warrior appears from the card, the longer the resuscitator will fly to revive him.<br>When approaching enemy warriors you can shoot them from a bow, causing damage. Besides you, your side towers of the Princess shoot at enemy warriors.<br>To win the battle, you must destroy the central tower of the enemy. Your warriors will begin to attack it only after the destruction of the side towers. If the battle time is up, and the score is equal, you are given extra time with accelerated energy production from the card resuscitator, at the end of which you need to destroy the enemy’s towers. If time ends, and the score is equal, the defeat is counted to the one who has less than the total health of the towers.<h2 class="bb_tag"> The development of the game </h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>adding new cards;<br></li><li>adding historical battles with the allies of Revelant;<br></li><li>game optimization;<br></li><li>add multiplayer;<br></li><li>improving the quality of the game;<br></li><li>adding customization of the castle and character;<br></li><li>work on game reviews and bugs.</li></ul>

Buy resources, hire workers and start from a scratch – settle down, erect buildings and create a plan for the growth. Don’t forget about the balanced development – you will need fields, farms, but also places like temples, stables, watchtowers and many more!<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1330430/extras/2eng.png?t=1595511434" /><br>First of all you have to choose the right place for the city of your dreams. Scan the surroundings and think big – draw up plans, send workers and prepare the land. Make sure that the soil there is fertile and that there are enough sources of fresh water available. Buy farm animals such as water buffalos and mules, and sow rice, millet or wheat. When you are ready with the fields – it’s time to start the constructions!<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1330430/extras/3eng.png?t=1595511434" /><br>Be a landlord that takes care of the people’s needs – in order to achieve that, you will have to become a great designer and an efficient manager as well. Do you have what it takes to run a city? Maintain a fragile balance between the satisfaction of the inhabitants and the town’s needs. Don’t exploit the workers or overuse the land. Choose the right buildings, map out the area and pave roads!	<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1330430/extras/4eng.png?t=1595511434" /><br>As soon as you start building your first city, you can already think ahead and plan the expansion! Would you rather grow peacefully or conquer? Trade or take over? Choose your own way of ruling and make all the necessary preparations – gather the materials, cut down the trees, establish the waterway trade routes, breed animals, grow crops and acquire new schematics of buildings.<br>How would you feel about erecting a great palace of yours?<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1330430/extras/5eng.png?t=1595511434" /><br>Make your cities blossom with the opportunities – take care of the economy and the development as well. Choose the right amount of fields to meet the farmers’ needs, but don’t neglect the warriors or the craftsmen – these groups need specific buildings. On the other hand, if you forget about the temples, gardens or markets, the citizens will not be satisfied with living in your town. And what is the city without its inhabitants? <br>Make the place more than a mere pile of boards – make it a home!<br><br>Sink into this oriental world and shape it to your liking. Make your citizens happy and cities thriving.

Delivers the full package of character building, strategic resource management, and a never-before-seen depth of real-time tactics!!<h2 class="bb_tag">Story</h2><br>Since the late 25th century, Earth's population has skyrocketed, and the face of our blue planet has been transformed into a complex grid of concrete, polymers, and steel. Oxygen trickles into the atmosphere by virtue of precious biospheres that dot the skies in a suspended fragile mesh several miles above the surface. Humans toil and commute alongside the masses of alien races that have since inhabited Earth's centers. Together they have concocted the most voluble and copious of environments known to mankind since the Garden of Eden. At the turn of the fourth millennium, pessimistic speculation led philosophers to believe that Earth was bound for troubled times and that great suffering would engulf the helpless inhabitants. As usual, they were wrong. In fact, in the years following the brutish skirmishes near the Orion Nebula, a strong feeling of general well being seemed to permeate even into the darkest corners of parliament, where a wild and daring decision concerning the treatment of prisoners was made; a chance for freedom that would supply the Galaxy with an extraordinary new form of entertainment ...

&quot;Gun party&quot; is a cooperative hard core double rocker Top Down shooting game. Where there are many zombies, play the survivor of zombie virus, fight side by side with other players, and take part in the intense self-defense counterattack to defeat the enemy<br />
<br />
*Support local 4 people in one screen game<br />
*Each level can upgrade weapons or attributes<br />
*5 optional roles, 10 different weapons, 13 checkpoints contain unique enemies, and well-designed boss war<br />
*1-2 hours of game time<br />
<br />
I like the Top Down shooting game very much, but the existing games need a lot of time to collect equipment and upgrade, so I can't play with my friends who took part in the game, so I made this game, which is characterized by being frank and ready to start a game with my friends at any time.<br />
Of course, this is also the shortcoming of this game. There are no long-term items and no archives. If you like collecting, then this game will disappoint you. However, if you want to have a frank shoot and a shoot with your friends, then this game will definitely suit you.<br />
hard core, some BOSS checkpoints are still difficult and require a little skill.<br />
<br />
This game only supports playing with the controller, because it is made independently, I have only tested the controllers of xbox and ps (please understand)

The Refrigerant Recovery Simulation app has been specially developed by RRA and TAFE to provide an innovative and hands-on way to for apprentices to understand the refrigerant recovery processes for different types of equipment.<br />
<br />
The processes for recovering refrigerant, pressure testing, evacuating and re-charging systems are critical for both upholding industry best practice and reducing the emission of ozone depleting and high GWP refrigerant gases.<br />
<br />
This app allows apprentices to fully understand the recovery process for split system air conditioners and commercial refrigeration systems, using the real world tools that are available to them to undertake work on these systems.<br />
<br />
Using the app, apprentices select a system and watch a detailed walkthrough before undertaking the process themselves through an interactive experience. By training with this modern-day tool, apprentices have a realistic experience of the process in a setting without the confines of the classroom, access to tools and the freedom to make errors without compromising safety all while reducing the likelihood of accidental emissions of refrigerant.<br />
<br />
The app boasts an extensive step-by-step guide of all processes with a high level of detail. Apprentices are even asked to select the virtual tools and protective personal equipment required for the process before beginning.<br />
<br />

Note that the full game has more activities, animals, locations, characters, items, quests, and a day night cycle!<br><br>Calico is a day-in-the-life community sim game where you are given an important and adorable task: rebuild the town’s cat café and fill it with cute and cuddly creatures! You will journey to a small village filled with magical girls and other fantastical friends, where you are placed in charge of a run down cat café. Build up your café by filling it with cute furniture, fun decorations, yummy pastries, and get it bustling with animals again!<br><br>Calico is meant to make you feel all warm and fuzzy inside. The gameplay reflects that with a laid back, low stress creative environment to explore and play in.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1328360/extras/102.gif?t=1592340272" /><br><br><strong>Character Creator</strong><br><br>The Calico character creator will allow players to create their own magical person to experience the world through. There will also be plenty of clothing to choose from and collect throughout the game!<br><br><strong>All animals are interactive!</strong><br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1328360/extras/101.gif?t=1592340272" /><br><br>The player will encounter many animals in the world of Calico. Once befriended, you can name them, add them to your party, or send them to their new home at the café. Animals in your party will follow you everywhere you go and listen to your commands. The animals in your cafe will relax and play with any customers that pop in for a visit.<br><br>Along with adding animals to your party, Interact with cats and other animals by petting and playing! Some of the animal interactions in Calico will include playing with toys, dancing, cuddling, petting, carrying, lounging with, and pampering. There will even be special features, like placing animals on your head! Special creatures like koi fish will be able to be fed, and the birds would love to be given seeds!<br><br><strong>Cafe Decoration</strong><br><br> Your task in Calico is to bring the town's café back to life again. This isn’t just achieved by bringing in cats and animals alone, however – <strong>you can also decorate your café with furniture and toys!</strong> We will have a full system that allows you to collect and arrange furniture, decorations, and toys. Some furniture is for the café’s human visitors, while other furniture is meant for your animal friends (like cat trees, scratching posts, and dog beds, to name a few options!). <br><br><strong>Cookin Minigame</strong><br><br> Create a wonderful café by making yummy bakes goods and drinks for the townspeople! We will have a system in which you can create and display pastries for sale in the café display cases, as well as create a drink menu. Some of the pastries and drinks will be customizable. For instance, the macaroons will have a surface on which you can paint designs~ <br><br><strong>Magic of Calico</strong><br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1328360/extras/100.gif?t=1592340272" /><br><br>We wanted there to be no limits to how you could find happiness in Calico. Magic potions are a system that allow us to break the rules of what is possible and to find what would be most fun. Example: the More-to-pet Potion allows the player to magically turn a single animal giant-sized! You can hang out with a giant animal, or even ride a giant cat!

Good security starts with a strong password! But strong passwords are difficult to remember. What if there was a way to remember a simple password and have it changed into a strong password token? Easy Password Tokenizer was made just for that. It turns your easy to remember password into a strong tokenized one. Install now and be safe!<br><br><strong>Why should I use Easy Password Tokenizer?</strong><br>Because humans are really bad at coming up with truly random passwords. People often use words or numbers that mean something to them: a pet’s name, their mother's maiden name, their kids’ birthdays, song lyrics, etc The problem with this is that you end up with passwords that are easy to guess. <br><br>And remember: it’s not humans who are doing the guessing. It’s computers. An ordinary desktop computer can test over a hundred million passwords per second — and this number climbs to billions of passwords per second if the computer is using GPU-based cracking tools. Password length and complexity are essential. <br><br>So don’t risk it. Use a random password generator like Easy Password Tokenizer to create long, truly random passwords that, even with the strongest computers, take ages to crack.<br><br><strong>No data is saved</strong><br>There are a lot of password solutions out there but most of them save passwords in a central place behind a master password. You essentially outsource your passwords to these solutions. If the website or app you use has a vulnerability or gets hacked you still lose all your passwords.<br>Easy Password Tokenizer does not save anything for you. All you need is an easy to remember password and it will generate the strong password for you.<br><br><strong>What are strong passwords?</strong><br>Long: The longer a password, the more secure it is. A strong password should be at least 12 characters long.<br>Random: Strong passwords are a combination of letters, numbers, cases and symbols to form an unpredictable string of characters that doesn’t resemble words or names.<br>Unique: A strong password should be unique to each account to reduce vulnerability in the event of a hack.<br><br><strong>Do I need a unique password for every account?</strong><br>Yes! Using the same password across multiple accounts is a huge no-no. If hackers learn the password to one of your accounts, they’ll have your password for all the others, too. So never recycle passwords. Use different, unique passwords for every account. (And no, simply adding an exclamation mark or other character to the end of a password does not make it unique or strong. Hackers can easily crack variations of passwords like this.)<br>With Easy Password Tokenizer however you can do this in your base password (the easy to remember one). Just adding one character to the end or changing the length changes the token completely!

Some people have signed contracts to work for the corporations, but you are a lone wolf – freedom over safety, right?!<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1327090/extras/solar_system_colonist2.png?t=1594997999" /><br>Prepare your spaceship and travel through the void between celestial bodies as well as glide above their surface. Try different vehicles and test yourself as a pilot. Upgrade your ship and wisely choose the destination – navigate between space junk and trace the route to your new home. Learn the history of the planets and impact their future – shall they can become bridgeheads of trade between colonies, research facilities or military bases? Choose the place that suits your needs best and settle down! <br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1327090/extras/solar_system_colonist3.png?t=1594997999" /><br>Red surface of the Mars, acid winds of the Venus or the icy, cold world of the Neptune – whichever environment you choose to live in, it will be filled with opportunities and adventures. Become a space cowboy and claim the new territory for yourself, but be aware that you are not the only one trying your hand in the colonization. Defend yourself against the corporations, other colonists and even against the pirates. In space no one can hear you scream!<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1327090/extras/solar_system_colonist4.png?t=1594997999" /><br>Build and expand your station – add rooms, wings and specialized spaces. Focus on discoveries, researches or just on admiring this completely new world. Determine direction of development – the success of the colonization rests entirely on your shoulders! Put on the space suit and go outside the station to explore the surroundings and decide upon the best strategy. Be aware that the environment is quite hostile. You have to do everything in your power to survive!<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1327090/extras/solar_system_colonist5.png?t=1594997999" /><br>Who knows what may lay beneath the thick layer of gases called the atmosphere? People aren’t the only threat in this new, briefly explored world. <br>Who knows what biological experiments were carried out here? <br>And by whom? <br>Who said life must be biological? <br>Maybe someone wants to buy samples? <br>To have equal chances, you will have to use the latest technology – weapons, lasers and also robots. The latter may be treated as just tools, but can be befriended as well. You’ll need all the help you can get, since the danger is constant and the encounter – inevitable. So, it’s better to be safe than sorry!<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1327090/extras/solar_system_colonist6.png?t=1594997999" /><br>Clear ceiling and dark space behind it. No one to bother you, no one to disturb you, but also no one to help you… Become self-sufficient, expand your base, explore the planet’s surface and earn some money. If you don’t feel like settling down on the planet, then simply change it! After all, you are the Solar System colonist experiencing the dawn of a new era in human spaceflight!

Unbeknownst to most people on Business Planet, the beginning of the end has arrived. Those that had prepared for this day were also The ones who caused it. At the center of it all is one, recently fired, CEO. The CEO of the terminated Suits City. When a city is recycled it is meant to be placed under total quarantine, fumigation and extermination. The Shareholders of Business Planet, framers of the Declaration of Busidependence, outlined this process in Addendum One: Redaction. However, in the world of business, employees are only as reliable as they are built to be, and the CEO is now a wanted fugitive. His crime, survival.

Take them out before they come for you, and stop the Shareholders from obtaining Absolute Power, lest they destroy anything and everything you've ever known. Or, perhaps, you will fall to the poisonous temptations of corruption before you have the opportunity to exact your vengeance on the world that created you and the world that seeks to destroy you.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1326560/extras/combat.png?t=1592254940" /><br><br>Suits: Absolute Power uses a Popsicle-Puppet, Sketch-Art style turn-based combat system.

Be the masta of your sabers and your people. Protect yourself and protect them.<h2 class="bb_tag">Game-play and features</h2>You will appear on an alien spaceship with two energysabers in your hands in deep space somewhere in a faraway galaxy. You can use your energysabers as sabers, shields, or even rail-guns to fight with incoming flying and crawling drones. The drones are coming in waves and you will lose some health every time a drone hits you. The health is restored after each completed wave. In order to complete a wave you need to kill all the drones in it, and each subsequent wave has an increased number of drones. Every drone in a new wave becomes more and more tricky to kill: faster, closer to appear, harder to hit. They can also carry some hidden drones inside and split when you expect that the least.<h2 class="bb_tag">Physical and mind activities</h2>- 360 arm swings<br>- 180 body rotation<br>- Squats<br>- Dodging lasers<br>- Precision training<br>- Attention exercising<br>- Spaceship walking if you have enough room<h2 class="bb_tag">Good luck!</h2>It's a VR deep-space experience.<br>It's a survival game.<h2 class="bb_tag">Discord</h2>Join our Discord server to share your feedback or get a free early adopter promo code:<br><br><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://discord.gg/Q4yEbzw" target="_blank" rel="noopener"  >https://discord.gg/Q4yEbzw</a>

Aliens have come to live in your solar system. They have many strange requirements for their new homes: some have an affinity for pollution others have a taste for colder temperatures and piles of Woolyfant leftovers. To each their own. You have been contracted to Climaform these worlds. Flying between asteroids and planets with your crew of Rebots, you will explore an ecosystem of wacky plants and animals. <br />
<br />
Each alien race has specific requirements for habitats, meaning you need to transform and design ecosystems, while dealing with the local wildlife, and potential sentient beings that might not condone your lease on the land. You are basically changing the climate of existing ecosystem, so you experience first-hand the effects of climate change and migration.<br />
<br />
Setting up loops to process resources will enable you to alter the very atmosphere around you and deal with the consequences!  To make your robots work, you need to program them. Or rather, you need to instruct your robot managers to instruct your robots workers. Hence, you learn how to program by creating your code and instructions directly in the world and seeing your robot operation automatically carrying out your carefully designed program in real time. You will feel the power of changing the environment and discover the mysteries of this robotic Galaxy. <br />
<br />
The levels are both handcrafted and procedurally generated using adventure graphs, creating diverse challenges tailored to you and your preferences. This creates endless yet diverse adventures for every mission.

<i>    “You who have sunk into depths of regularity, answer this - are you content with your life? <br>    You wake up, do your chores, eat, and go to sleep - is this cycle satisfying? You are full of ideas for something greater, something grander, the center of which will be you. Yet, you see that the realization of these dreams lies in the past. With the influence of enthusiasm or fear, you try to do something about it, feeling somewhere in the back of your mind, that unlike the proverbial snake that bites its tail, you do yet another useless spin around the wheel of the ordinary. And in this maelstrom, you are surprised when life gives you a challenge. You overcome it to return to the usual spin of ten thousand things, with a keen understanding that you have done something grand - yet you inevitably realize that everyone around you has gone through the same ordeals.

Rules of the game:<br />
The game turns out to be a fusion of point-to-click adventures and escape rooms.<br />
Each room contains a series of puzzles that will take you to the next one, until you get to an unexpected ending...<br />
You play with a first-person view so you can be more involved in the game environment.<br />
In most cases, an item collected in a room will be used in the gaming phase that follows. Each message that is automatically kept in the journal contains clues to how to solve a rebus.<br />
each puzzle has an intuitive logic, but to facilitate the game in some puzzles there is a help that can be useful even if you think you have lost some clues.<br />
<br />
History:<br />
The protagonist of the story is a police detective named Roy who has been entrusted with the case of the serial killer known as &quot;The Mentalist&quot;, a dark figure who kills his victims without leaving any trace. His long history of crimes made him famous and, over time, he found followers ready to help him.<br />
<br />
One of them, a Peter Thompson, was brutally killed by his own master.<br />
<br />
Investigating the murders of the Mentalist, the police found Peter's diary, a very important subject for the investigation as inside were described all the crimes he had witnessed, but above all they found important news about one of the mentalist's many shelters.<br />
<br />
Peter describes this place in such detail that Roy can track him down, and so begins the adventure that aims to capture the Mentalista and put an end to the terrible crimes of this fearsome murderer.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, however, Peter in his notes neglects to mention the huge amount of secret doors and passages that the &quot;Mentalist&quot; mansion hides and so Roy, unaware of what was waiting for him, decides to venture alone, without help, in fact he is convinced that he can take it taking advantage of the surprise effect, but as often happens things will not thread as expected.<br />
<br />
I hope you enjoy the game. Happy Game!
<strong>Brain Please Don’t</strong> lets you try Cameron’s week with various different versions of the teenager, and each choice made along the way changes Cameron’s inner universe, and the deck that represents it.<br><br>In each encounter, play the cards that represent Cameron’s inner workings, thoughts and impulses. Like in any teenager’s life, avoiding self-doubt, anxiety and inadequacy will be a constant challenge. Those challenges can only be meaningfully overcome if the psyche changes to manage them, if you build the deck into a better version of itself through the choices made.<br><br>Having better mental states give you access to more answers, and good answers can sometimes create better general states of mind. The game is all about trying to construct positive psychological spirals, while also looking at what happens when that can’t be the case. <br><br>Not all endings are always happy, not all darkness is always pitch black, and only your take of each playthrough can explore the various paths and destinations of this short game.

Grit Paintball is a Virtual Reality tournament paintball trainer and simulator. Aimed mostly at current paintball players looking to gain an edge in the real game, Grit allows players to practice from home.<br />
<br />
Grit uses a mouse, keyboard and monitor for the menu and field building parts of the game, and then you enter VR to experience the field you've designed.<br />
<br />
Grit Paintball has an in game layout editor featuring the 2019 NXL Paintball bunker set, which can be locally saved and loaded, as well as easily shared between players by sending a small text file via email or messenger. By utilising VR, a player can gain an edge by being able to 'walk' a field layout before a real life event and find blind shots, bounce shots, lanes and other areas which could be missed when walking a real field before an event. It also allows field owners and tournament operators to walk their field design to see whether adjustments need to be made before publishing a layout for a real event.<br />
<br />
Targets are also included in the field editor, allowing players to practice muscle memory for breakouts, snap shots and, with a large enough play area, moves from bunker to bunker. <br />
<br />
The game only requires one VR controller (but will detect 2) as it's designed so the player can replicate the feel of swapping their gun from hand to hand. It is fully compatible with the Vive Tracker, or using a VR controller. Custom hardware is being developed to allow players to utilise their own paintball gun with a Vive Tracker so that players can get the most immersive and realistic feel possible. Of course, anyone can design their own hardware if they have a Vive Tracker!

For us the low-poly style can be seen as a gaming equivalent to minimalism and as huge fans of science fiction we wanted to focus on the fiction and merge the usual complicated universe of scifi with the low poly minimalism to give another perspective to the scifi genre.<br><br>We want to give players the freedom to draw their way through the environment in any way they wish. If we do it right, we can create in-game narratives using the strengths of the medium without reliance on cut-scenes, dialogue, special effects, and user-interfaces.<br><br>If we had to define the niche of our game on the shelf of a video-game store, we’d imagine our game being somewhere in between “a short hike”, ”arctico” &amp; “cloudpunk”.

A person who experienced a traumatic or otherwise shocking experience, can find it difficult to process this on their own. This can lead to recurring and stubborn psychological complaints. EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) is a form of therapy that offers the eyes and/or ears of the client rhythmic visual and/or auditory stimuli, switching between left and right. The purpose is to reopen communication between different parts of the brain, making it more accessible to process the experience.<br />
<br />
The advantages to do this in VR, are that the visual stimulus always remains centered in view, distractions from the client’s physical environment are minimized, there is a variety of different pendula, sounds, movement speeds and directions for the therapist to choose from. Most of all, the therapist can now fully focus on their contact with the client.<br />
<br />

In the game you’ll explore, hunt the indigenous giant alien bugs, build outposts and craft weapons and equipment as you attempt to survive and build a life for yourself in the hostile alien environment.<br><br><strong>Chill COOP experience</strong><br>We want people to experience our game with their friends, discover the world and work together to survive.<br><br><strong>Top down view - environmental narration</strong><br>The top down view gives another way of storytelling and environmental design.<br>The low poly art style works also very well with a top down view and focus only on the most important part in the environment.<br><br><strong>A colorful scifi atmosphere</strong><br>We want to bring a chill, positive and colorful experience. Far away from the usual dark scifi worlds. A friendly, calm, joyful experience on an alien planet.<br><br>we have a unique non-linear storyline driven by dynamic events which will shape your adventure.<br>The players will be confronted by unpredictable hand crafted events driven which will uncover the different paths for the story and lead them through in-game narratives using the strengths of the medium without reliance on cut-scenes.<h2 class="bb_tag">WHERE IT COMES FROM</h2><br>We created this game during the covid-19 because we wanted to escape ourselves and stay busy.We decided to depict a colorful and relaxing universe where everybody could just unwind during this weird period in the world.<br><br>We are looking to present the story in a nonlinear setting, allowing the player to set the pace, focus on details and fill the gaps with his imagination and go back and look again at things that he thinks he missed to uncover everything we wanted to tell.<br><br>Our artistic vision pushed us toward Low-poly and to us it is an amazing way to create clarity through simplicity. For us the low-poly style can be seen as a gaming equivalent to minimalism and as huge fans of science fiction we wanted to focus on the fiction and merge the usual complicated universe of scifi with the low poly minimalism to give another perspective to the scifi genre.<br><br>We want to give players the freedom to draw their way through the environment in any way they wish. If we do it right, we can create in-game narratives using the strengths of the medium without reliance on cut-scenes, dialogue, special effects, and user-interfaces.<br><br>If we had to define the niche of our game on the shelf of a video-game store, we’d imagine our game being somewhere in between “a short hike”, ”arctico” &amp; “cloudpunk”.

Oirbo will ultimately have 5 different areas to explore. The demo takes place in the <strong>Nature </strong>area the &quot;2nd&quot; area of the game. This is subjective since after the first area (the warehouse) you can pretty much explore all the other 4 areas at will (although you won't be able to fully explore any of them without finding and unlocking all skills). The remaining area code names are <strong>Medical</strong>, <strong>Mechanical</strong>, and <strong>Control</strong>.<br><br>The demo will have 2 unlocked skills, the <strong>Night Vision</strong> and the <strong>Dash </strong>enabling you to explore about 3/4 of the area, the only aspects that you won't be able to explore are sections that require some skills unlocked later in the game. <br><br>Since the entire nature area is open to exploration, the demo time can vary depending on the route you take and what side content you decide to see. You can expect between <strong>30 minutes</strong> to <strong>2 hours</strong> of content depending on how far you explore the Nature area.<br><br>The demo ends after you defeat the area boss, but you can play it as many times as you wish. <br><br>We disabled/blocked a few game features for this demo, such as the lore memories, the spacecraft logs, fast traveling, all borders to adjacent areas, and the game save system. The latter implies that every time you exit the game or go back to the main menu, the demo will restart from the beginning.

VR-NISSAGE #3 with John Wentz is an interactive art exhibition featuring twenty-two original paintings by muralist, street artist and portrait painter John Wentz from San Francisco. This art exhibition is downloaded directly to your computer where it is experienced only in virtual reality, and you can freely walk around in the exhibition space and your real-life motions are reflected in the virtual reality environment.<br />
This is not a game to play, it is simply a virtual reality art exhibition to explore and see these amazing works of art. If you enjoy visiting art exhibitions, but you can't due to the coronavirus, this is a safe way for you to visit an art exhibition from your home. Set in a natural space to display these paintings, virtual reality transforms your room into a serene open space to escape to. Each painting has been carefully replicated in virtual reality to exact measurements, color and texture of the original artworks.<br />
For the VR-NISSAGE series, we set out to create a better experience on every level than going to an actual art gallery opening. Having spent more than a decade going to prominent art galleries around the world, we have a good understanding of what makes for a good experience at a vernissage. VR-NISSAGE is the next  evolution of the art gallery. An art gallery that only exists in virtual reality, but can reach a much larger international audience. Each virtual reality exhibition space is totally designed around the artworks to present the paintings in a truly fascinating and engaging environment for the visitor. You can choose to visit the virtual reality exhibition alone to see the paintings quietly, meet with just your friends from around the world and discuss the art, or converse with new people and other art aficionados.<br />
For each exhibition we produce, we create a hyperrealistic true-to-life 3D live animated model of the artist that can can meet and have a conversation with collectors inside the virtual space. The artist wears a full body 3D motion capture suit with realtime facial scanning so that the avatar of the artist in virtual reality can interact live and have a conversation with those attending the exhibition.<br />
Since 2012, we have worked producing exhibitions internationally with some of the most prominent contemporary artists in the world.<br />
<br />
John WENTZ BIO<br />
John Wentz is a contemporary artist whose work is an exploration of process and technique. Working within the classical idiom of the human figure, his goal is to reduce and simplify the image to its core fundamentals: composition, color, and mark-making. Paint application and brush strokes are broad and simplified as a means to connect and convey these ideas to the viewer with an abstract sensibility. He has had 5 solo exhibitions in San Francisco and numerous group exhibitions both nationally and internationally. His works have appeared in many publications and have won multiple awards.

It is fast and with its lightweight 75mm main gun it packs a serious punch compared to other light tanks. The Chaffee is often used in harassing tactics against heavier tanks.<br><br><strong>M3 Lee</strong>	<br>The ‘General Lee’ is an American medium tank armed with a 75mm sponson mounted main gun, as well as a 37mm turret-mounted gun. It requires an experienced tank crew to get the full benefit of this special tank.<br><br><strong>M4A3E2 Sherman 'Jumbo'</strong><br>In order to counter the formidable German tanks until the M26 Pershing becomes available, this Sherman has been heavily modified. The Jumbo’s 178mm frontal glacis is able to resist a direct hit from the Tiger, but the added weight comes at the cost of manoeuvrability.<br><br><strong>M18 Hellcat</strong><br>The M18 Hellcat is an American tank destroyer.

It is armed with a .50 and a .30 caliber machine gun mounted in two separate turrets. It is fast and dangerous to infantry and lightly armored vehicles.<br><br><strong>1911 Pistol</strong><br>The 1911 Pistol is a well proven, effective and hard hitting handgun.

Ideal for use in the field where tools for mechanical work and self-defence are sparse.<br><br><strong>Ribbon Boosters</strong><br>Ribbon Boosters will accelerate the progress on all your soldiers during combat.

It is protected in some parts by 60mm thick sloped armor making it hard to destroy for enemy light tanks. It is armed with a 45mm cannon and a 7.62mm machine gun. <br><br><strong>T-28 Model 1934</strong><br>This early Soviet tank is one of the first tanks to feature a multi-turret design. It proves a serious threat on the battlefield when manned by a skilled crew. The T-28 is a very sturdy tank that is cheap and easy to repair.<br><br><strong>KV-85</strong><br>Faced with the threat of the mighty Panther, the Soviets have decided to field the KV-85 as a stopgap until heavier IS tanks become available. The KV-85 is comparable to the Tiger I but is much cheaper to produce and easier to repair.<br><br><strong>SU-85</strong><br>The ‘Samokhodnaya Ustanovka-85’ is a medium Soviet tank destroyer. Its long barreled 85mm main cannon is able to penetrate even the Tiger I at the distance of 1000 meters. It has a low profile and good mobility.<br><br><strong>T-38 Model 1937</strong><br>The T-38 is a small Soviet scout tank. It is fast and is armed with a single 7.62mm DT machine gun and serves best in the role of infantry support.<br><br><strong>Tula Tokarev 33</strong><br>The TT-33 is a soviet semi-automatic pistol.

In this game you play as a Monstaal, a creature transformed from another realm, that strives to destroy bosses and collect spheres to return to your home world. The game includes two modes: Story and Horde. The story mode depicts you trying to escape the world you've been sent to by cleansing it of enemies to open the doorway. Conversely the horde mode is a fast paced mob killing mode where you cannot allow enemies to overrun the zones.<br><br>The three playable characters are: Darkat, Stabight and Sleaf. Darkat is a dark creature that relies on pushing enemies away with a roar and piercing them with a long range shadow ball. Stabight is a close range attacker with displacement utility to bring enemies into range or push them away. Sleaf is the late-game damage dealer who might be larger and slower than the others but fires multiple grass-based projectiles at enemies for massive damage.<br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1321520/extras/MarketingGIFs.gif?t=1590768409" /><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1321520/extras/MarketingGIFs2.gif?t=1590768409" /><br><br>There are 8 standard enemies and 4 bosses to demolish throughout each mode. The enemies vary in speed and damage with different traits like chasing, dashing, exploding and launching projectiles with different attributes. Some projectiles affect your movement speed so the enemy can get into attack range while others will explode on environmental collision.<br><br>The controls are rather simple: arrow keys to move, Z to use your skill, X to use your ability, SPACE BAR to dash and SHIFT to lock your position for aiming. The game supports multiple resolutions but is optimized for 1920x1080. The music in the game was crafted by upcoming YouTube artists and leaves you feeling immersed and engaged in the game.<br><br>Try setting your fastest story mode time and lasting as long as possible in the horde to unlock Steam achievements!

With a quick and deliberate hand, the great city of Karek was turned to a mountain of green glass, its many thousands of denizens entombed within. The harbor towns of M’blark were next to fall, the warm waters lapping against the jagged frozen shapes of those caught unaware. Even the very earth below its shadow became glass, left to shatter into crude and useless shapes. The elder of the First Tribe bade his people to pay it tribute, for in his ignorance he considered it a divine messenger from the gods they worshipped then. Of those that knelt before it, none were spared. And thus the Blight Lord was given its name, for the certain ruin of our people followed it like some merciless plague.<h2 class="bb_tag">Nemesis: Wayward One</h2><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1321770/extras/waywardone.jpg?t=1593007849" /><br>This creature is an oddity, even amongst its odd kind, trapped in a place neither here nor there. The scouts first saw it from the west wall, flickering against the vault of the cave. They say it wailed as it fluttered through the city’s defenses like a broken ghost. A merchant in the dirt market made the mistake of brushing the wisps of its floating form as she threw up her hands in horror. She began to fade away as soon as the dust of the thing sifted between her fingers. And then it too was gone. Like us, it is lost. Of all The Nameless that have plagued us here in our last sanctum, the Wayward One alone seems almost tormented by the task. The breach mages say they show compassion toward the wretched thing by fighting against it with all their might, for like us, it is seeking an end to its struggle.<h2 class="bb_tag">Breach Mage Mentor: Malastar</h2><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1321770/extras/malastar.jpg?t=1593007849" /><br>You can always tell which younglings will be mages. Mostly, they are girls, but sometimes a boy-child will carry the spark, though weaker than their sister-kind. Training each of them is my sad calling, for mages come and go like the black days in this place. First, they learn the sister-words, the mage’s tongue, the language of all things. Next we fashion them a gem, one that is theirs alone, a conduit for their nascent power. After this, Kadir takes them deep within the bowels of the cave, where they must find their way back with only their gem to protect them. Many find their way home, but we have lost many would-be mages in my years. A student’s last task is to slay a beast, armed again only with their gem and their wits. The child is dropped down a shaft outside Chasmwalk, left alone with whatever miscreation we have snared from the void. Sometimes the creature is wounded, weak, but always they are hungry. A student that navigates this ordeal is named apprentice. After that, one need only survive long enough to earn the rank of mage.
TAG (Touch And Go) is based off the classic children's game - Tag, in which a single player is &quot;It&quot; and must touch another player then run away, this new player becomes &quot;It&quot; and the cycle repeats.

<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong><u>Overview</u></strong></h2><strong>Externus: Path of the Solari</strong> is a character-driven tactical roleplaying game (RPG) adapted from an original tabletop game. We take inspiration from classic tactical RPGs along with modern game development to craft our own story and give you characters that matter. Our approach is designed to allow you to get to know the characters in your party along with strategic combat in full 3D environments. We encourage party interaction through our campfire scenes and storybook sequences that pay homage to the original tabletop game.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong><u>Features</u></strong></h2><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Strategic Turn-Based Tactical Combat<br></li><li>Full 3D Battlefields<br></li><li>Character-Driven Story<br></li><li>Storybook Choose Your Own Adventure Sequences<br></li><li>Death Matters, Each Ally You Lose Will Change Your Story<br></li><li>Unique Full-Color Artstyle<br></li><li>Based On An Original Tabletop RPG </li></ul><br>We're currently expecting to launch the game in the Summer of 2021.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong><u>Gameplay</u></strong></h2><strong>Externus: Path of the Solari </strong>features classic turn-based gameplay. Our battles will take place in <strong>full 3D battlefields</strong> that allow you to rotate the camera a full 360 degrees. Our character-driven story will be told using those battlefields alongside interactive story sequences featuring custom artwork. You can traverse our world using a map that highlights the two distinct continents that make up the world of Externus. The world map features unique artwork inspired by early cartography.  <br><br><strong>Externus: Path of the Solari</strong> uses a turn-based battle system that takes advantage of our full 3D battlefields to make sure you can see all angles of the battlefield. This will help you weigh all your options from a tactical standpoint. The detailed battlefields feature elevation and other tactical landscapes to use to your advantage when facing your opponent. Sometimes it's just easier to push someone off a cliff, right? Your choices make all the difference in combat.<br><br>Our goal for the battle system in <strong>Externus: Path of the Solari</strong> is to challenge the player so that they feel accomplished in defeating their foes. You should think about the risks and rewards of bringing certain characters and using their specialized abilities. Your actions and choices matter. Think about the world in terms of fate. Was it fate that a character died? Was it a punishment from the gods or just a mistake caused by an error in tactics? Death will be permanent in Externus, how will you react? Let the story play out and see how a character's death affects those who knew them both in positive and negative ways. Maybe it'll even send a ripple effect out into the world!<br><br><strong>Externus: Path of the Solari</strong> is a storybook brought to life and your actions on and off the battlefield can change the pages as they're presented. This goes back to our tabletop roots of wanting to tell a collective story that changes based on the players around the table.<br><br><strong><u><h2 class="bb_tag">Story</h2></u></strong><br>The world of <strong>Externus: Path of the Solari</strong> was crafted through years of playing the tabletop game and was a world created with friends. Fate plays a large role in our world as the balance between order and chaos is constantly shifting. We find ourselves in a time where two Gods have been slain by a powerful unknown enemy. Was fate in play here or did the Gods' time end before it was supposed to? Can even the Gods escape Fate or will the world be plunged into chaos?<br><br>The story of <strong>Externus: Path of the Solari</strong> follows Osmund Steele and his sons Alrik and Amante as they travel through the continents of Alcretia and Katrona. Osmund is part of an order known as the Soldat Solari, a tradition he intends to pass down to his sons, that is tasked with keeping balance and order throughout the world of Externus. Our story begins as we follow the Steele family and their companions on their way toward the town of Zyais when they run into unexpected trouble from a mysterious group known as The Monotheists. This group of zealots is led by a man named Gabriel who has a history with Osmund and the Soldat Solari. Was it fate that brought them together on this day? Was it the will of the gods? With Gabriel in the picture and rumors swirling of a larger threat, known only as The Abomination, the Steele family will have a lot of roadblocks in their way as they try to keep the balance of the world from shifting into chaos. Will your choices balance things or plunge them further into chaos? What does Fate have in store for you and your companions? Death matters in the world of Externus and losing an ally can change the story.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong><u>About Winterborn</u></strong></h2><strong>Winterborn</strong> was formed by Kent Gambill in November of 2018 to make a tactical role-playing game set in a world he created over 15 years ago as a tabletop game.

Did you think you'd win with a snap of your fingers? Did you think you'd see a crew as a number? Did you think you'd gorge without fear of judgements?<br />
But, sir, you're not in the Royal Navy. The pirate's life is a life of dreams. And it's precisely because we have a shitty life that we have dreams.<br />
<br />
Put yourself in the shoes of a quartermaster. Come and discover the real life of a pirate, a man who has left the tyrannical but honest world of kings and emperors in order to sail in equality and freedom.<br />
You will have to manage the ambition of a captain, because you guess that his choices will not always go well with those of the crew. Thus, you will have to confront your captain in order to defend your men's rights. Avoiding injustice is essential on a ship with so few hierarchies, and without a military institution.<br />
But who knows? Perhaps you will prefer to defend your captain's wishes?<br />
<br />
Your everyday enemies will be hunger and thirst, for sure.<br />
But a sailor's worst enemy is disease. Know how to defend yourself against it.<br />
<br />
You will cruise from island to island by sail or on steamboats that you can optimize as you wish.<br />
At each new game, the map will be generated procedurally. The wealth and characteristics of peoples will be redistributed randomly.<br />
<br />
You will experience the phases of ship management in a turn based system, punctuated by the sound of the watch bell. The time unit on a boat is not the day, but the watch, because an unattended ship is a ship on the ocean floor that shelters sharks and octopuses.<br />
<br />
You will have to transmit orders during the cannon phases like a QTE, and fight fiercely like in an A-RPG during collisions. Initially, you will understand that life on a ship is slow, because all travels are long, otherwise, during battles life suddenly intensifies and the pace changes.<br />
<br />
Also remember that there may be women on the ship, you may even be one of them. You would operate in the shadows, because a woman is not accepted on a ship. She brings bad luck. But don't forget: if there is a deck where a woman can end up imposing herself, end up being accepted, it's the deck of a pirate ship!<br />
<br />
Treasure maps, monkey business and discoveries will also spice up your daily life in the ocean.

Do you know how to kill a ghost or vanquish a vampire? Can you find creative uses for household chemicals, power tools, and ancient tomes of magic? Will you stop at nothing to realize your goals, not even great personal risk, or murder? Being an actor in a yogurt commercial will test you in all these ways, and more.<br><br><br>Yogurt Commercial 3 is a sandbox puzzle adventure game. As the new star actor in town, it is your job to collect the items and abilities you need in order to film commercials of increasing complexity. The client (Bob Yogurt™) is tough to please, and they know no boundaries in the search for the Ultimate Yogurt Commercial of All Time.<h2 class="bb_tag">Redefine the nature of the yogurt advertisement industry</h2>A yogurt commercial might go off the rails. Whether you are attacked by a gang of greasers, assault a clown, poison your co-star, or set off a vomit chain reaction, the focus group will dutifully react to whatever you have captured on tape, providing honest reviews and constructive criticism. Will your commercials push the boundaries of taste and decency? Will the lawyer need to get involved? What <i>will</i> it take to please the client?<h2 class="bb_tag">Enlarge your power</h2>Craft potions, collect tools, choose your perks, and learn the tactics required to walk through an active volcano or survive in a vacuum, like yogurt commercial actors are frequently required to do. Knowledge is power, like the knowledge of how to make a flamethrower out of a squirt gun and household chemicals!<h2 class="bb_tag">The most accurate yogurt commercial simulation since Yogurt Commercial 2</h2>Characters dynamically react to your in-game actions, by putting out fires, fleeing from danger, greeting strangers, delivering pizza, fighting back with weaponry, vomiting uncontrollably, flying into a mob of violence, while reacting to each other and creating emergent chaos. Your own character will react to and remember the occurrences they witness.<br><br>Hurl procedurally generated insults and threats in order to provoke those foolish enough to stand in your way, or assume control of any other character in the game to take their abilities and collect their items!<h2 class="bb_tag">Explore the limits of space and time</h2>Your quest covers a large game world full of puzzles to solve, items to collect, characters to meet, and potions to craft. Travel deep beneath the Earth's surface, to distant worlds, and maybe even open an ancient forbidden gate to the underworld in order to shoot on location.

Step into the epic, story-rich world of the wildly popular Redwall books. The Scout is an episodic adventure game full of vivid characters, high adventure, and most importantly, the first new official Redwall story since 2011. The second episode, “The Wraith,&quot; tells the story of Liam and Sophia’s desperate escape from their home, which has been raided by pirate rats. They race together to the Winsome Wraith, where mysterious and dangerous stoats may offer the help they need…or may kill them where they stand.<br />
 <br />
Choose to play as either Liam or Sophia, the newest member of the Lilygrove Scout Corps, a group of woodland rangers tasked with the protection of the land and trained in the ancient ways of woodcraft. The environment is dangerous enough, but creatures like Scumsnout, Cheesethief, and Captain Snow each shadow your steps as well.<br />
 <br />
It will take all of your wit and guile to make it out alive!<br />
 <br />
Mechanics<br />
“The Scout, Act 2” continues innovating in its dynamic scent system, unlike any game before it. The dynamic scent system has doubled in capacity and joins with scent prints, tracking, masking and more.<br />
 <br />
Outside of scent, “The Scout” is alive with both friend and foe — each sporting their own stories, values, and motives. It’s up to the player to decide whether they will prioritize the mission and leave the others to fend for themselves, or take the time to lend a helping paw.<br />
 <br />
Other new features include major updates to the wayglass, slingshot, and conversation systems, which allow the player to dive even deeper into a script that is more extensive than episode one, and that continues the tales of beloved characters — as well as introducing new friends and foes. <br />
 <br />
With courage, faith, and friends by your side, Lilygrove’s fate rests in your paws.<br />
 <br />
Features<br />

Together we have nurtured a product that we believe captures the original heart of Brian Jacques’ masterpiece. Between authentic musical scores, digitally sculpted art, an inspired narrative, and an original dynamic scent system, “The Lost Legends of Redwall™” hopes to earn its place among the influential games of the new millennium.

This is my dream project known as Farmer Time: A Magical Farming Adventure that follows a wizard in its adventure with inheriting a farm which the wizard will need to keep from going bankrupt. Where Farmer Time differs from other farming simulators is the mechanic where the seeds you plant are all the same and will only grow into the same plant, but you can craft and buy spells to change attributes of the seed which will result in a new plant growing with its own characteristics and price. I have been working on this project now for about two weeks and has almost gotten the core gameplay down for now and will soon (in 0.5-1 months) polish the game and add additional gameplay variations and quirks.<br />

About me: I am a programmer that has been programming for around 6-7 years as a hobby and has been studying Java programming for about 2 years now and has been programming in C# prior to that for around 4-5 years now. I have always built games as a prototype for what I can do or as a game for myself to play just for fun but now I think i have polished my programming knowledge enough to warrant a public game release.

Save these dinguses from themselves! You play as one of them and are (hopefully) not quite as dumb as they are. Run around and grab objects to place for the Nummels to use, so they can find their way without suffering some terrible fate!<br />
<br />
Nummels may be dumb, but they're predictable. When they see a ladder, they will always climb it. If they find some gum on the ground, they'll stop and chew it. If they fall in the water, they will stop breathing. It's up to you to move things around so that your litter of Nummels can make it through each level to the exit. On most levels you can take your time and set everything up before letting them loose, but to get good scores and unlock all the things, you'll need to go fast. Each level has a leaderboard that's scored based on saving all the Nummels the fastest. A few Nummels may have been harmed during the production of this game.

Gladiators Manager is a game set in the ancient Roman Empire that leads you into a brutal world which can only be escaped through death or wealth. Should you choose the latter, you will rebuild a failing school of gladiators to forge your path to glory. You begin with managing a school on the edge of bankruptcy and slowly expand it by adding and upgrading buildings. Providing the best staff and facilities for gladiators fighting in your name will quickly pay off. To succeed in arenas you need to prepare suitable equipment and teach your gladiators skills that allow them to survive. Test your might on less prestigious arenas before you take on the mightiest warriors of the known world in the Roman Colosseum. Further in the game you will be facing diverse challenges. Your best gladiators might die or retire as you pursue significant goals, such as earning the patronage of the local governor. You might also be forced to relocate your school to avoid local conspiracies and seek fame in more wealthy regions.<br><br>If you remember that fortune favors the bold we will soon meet among the Roman elite.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1318190/extras/Gladiator_Label_Steam__Manage.png?t=1590581926" /><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1318190/extras/gladiator_szkoa.gif?t=1590581926" /><br>Expand your ludus (gladiator school) to unlock new weapons and training options for your future champions.

<h2 class="bb_tag">D&amp;D Classics: PHBR13 Complete Druid's Handbook</h2>Druids love forests, true - but they love the arctic tundra, tropical rain forests, broad savannas, and fungi caverns of the Underdark, too. This 128-page accessory expands the living world of the druid in the AD&amp;D 2nd Edition game, bringing new homes, character kits, personalities, spells, magical items, herbal lore, and a hundred details on druidic society, sacred groves, and high-level aspirations.<br>This book has it all - don't leave the woods without it!<h2 class="bb_tag">Product History</h2>The Complete Druid's Handbook (1994) by David Pulver tackles the problematic situation of the druid in AD&amp;D. Along with the paladin, druids have always been a challenge for many players to play effectively; true neutral isn't necessarily an alignment that comes easily to a lot of players, and the druid is one of the few classes that requires player characters to duel a NPC in order to advance to high levels.<br>This supplement takes on the challenge head-on with six chapters and several appendices that cover mechanical expansions for the class (such as new spells, variant druids, variant races, and a number of druidic kits), and roleplaying advice to help both with individual characters and with the vast druidic hierarchies to which these characters belong. The advice helps neutral characters justify why they should adventure with non-neutral companions, advice that's often needed.<br>&quot;That Giant Spider Can Control Mold!&quot; PHBR13 starts out with the fascinating topic of druids from non-forest environments. There are arctic druids, desert druids, jungle druids, swamp druids, and more. One of the most interesting variant druidic branches is the gray druid, an underground and cavern-based variant who can shapechange into a giant spider and control jellies, molds, and fungi. I'm not sure if it's effective in everyday adventuring, but it's extremely handy in dungeons or the Underdark. This approach is indicative of the book as a whole; it's a nice mixture of imagination and solid advice.<br>&quot;Why Is That Woman Covered with Bees?&quot; Probably because she's a hivemaster, one of the 14 druidic kits in this book. In additon to that one, though, there are some particularly good ideas in this section: a lost druid, bitter and evil due to having lost their lands to destruction and who now plot devastation and revenge; pacifist druids, who survive through negotiation and diplomacy; outlaw druids, hunted for their actions. All good stuff. Even better, kits are generally well-balanced, with mechanical hindrances to match the mechanical benefits, and there are even kits that are focused entirely on flavor, offering no mechanical changes at all.<br><strong> Pulver really gets this section right.</strong> Not all of the kits are scintillating for player characters - you may not find the &quot;village druid&quot; out adventuring, but instead at home focusing on the village's agriculture - but that's forgivable and understandable. This is a solid and useful section.<br><strong> The Druidic Order Summons a Moot.</strong> Chapter 3 and 4 cover druidic orders and roleplaying. The concept of a druidic order is one that's generally foreign to most players; I suspect that most druids in a AD&amp;D game operate independently until they reach high levels, and then suddenly they have to fight someone to advance. Chapter 3 gives context and meaning to the druidic order, breaking down its organization, goals, and responsibilities. Druidic &quot;bans&quot; are also introduced, where druids who sin against the order are exiled. And of course this section houses rules for the infamous druidic challenge.<br>Interestingly, this book also gives information about the Shadow Circle, a tolerated group of fairly evil druids who see nature as a hostile, cleansing force. This gives DMs an easy method for using druids as antagonists without bringing in Order politics.<br>The roleplaying chapter is exhaustive, giving the advice you'd expect about the True Neutral alignment, and then following this up with excellent sections on faith, responsibilities, and concrete strategies for holding to druidic responsibilities. It's good, solid, practical advice that can easily make playing a druid much more fun. But there's much more in this book: New spells, new magic items, herbal magic, and features of sacred groves are all discussed in detail. The section on groves is particularly interesting, providing a myriad of plot hooks, along with rules for adding permanent and unusual magic effects into groves or standing stones.<br>The Complete Druid's Handbook is fun to read, packed with good (and balanced!) new rules, and it can help players who are faced with an unusual class. While most of the information applies to AD&amp;D, the section on sacred groves and the superb roleplaying advice translate well into other editions of the game, if not into other fantasy games altogether. This book is one of the stand-outs in the Complete series.<br><strong> About the Creators.</strong> David Pulver is a Canadian freelance author and game designer with over 50 roleplaying game credits to his name. He has written extensively for Steve Jackson's GURPS, along with games for TSR, Guardians of Order, White Wolf Publishing, GDW, West End Games, and ICE.<br><strong> About the Product Historian</strong><br>History and commentary of this product was written by Kevin Kulp, game designer and admin of the independent D&amp;D fansite ENWorld.<br> <br> <strong>Requires:</strong> An active subscription or a one time purchase of a Fantasy Grounds Full or Ultimate license and the included 2E ruleset as well as the D&amp;D Classics: Player's Handbook (2E).

It is 1989, due to a breakthrough success of the so-called Star Wars space defense program the United States has become a sole state entirely protected from a nuclear weapon attack. Its influence has since spread over most of the world through both diplomatic and military measures. <br />
USSR weakened by a devastating defeat in the Afghan War has been swiftly overtaken. Many large cities lie in ruin, others are being controlled by the US military forces. While the occupants are establishing control over the new territories rebels are gaining more and more members each day, many of whom have combat experience.<br />
In the demo you play as a rebel recruit tasked with retrieving an item from the enemy base. You can go in guns blazing or take out the guards silently (for the most advanced players there is a non lethal way through).

A couple of adventurers named Christopher and Clara once traveled the world in search of ancient treasure and the secrets of the universe. During one of their expeditions they met a cute puppy and named him Marty. Since then he has always traveled with them and is passionate about adventure and digging. <br />
<br />
While hunting down a mysterious artifact called the Heart of Space, Clara suddenly disappeared. Exhausted from searching, Christopher returned to camp, where his faithful friend Marty was looking for him. Heartbroken, the experienced adventurer almost gave up on archaeology.<br />

<h2 class="bb_tag">Story</h2>  In 2048, Moogi star sued Earth for emojis violating Moogi's right to portrait. The Supreme Court of the Galaxy ruled that Earth lost the case, Earth must hand over emojis and compensation. Moogi, who have mastered the power of Tao force, come to Earth, Earth unable to resist. Moogi's great starship, full of emojis and compensation packed in cubes, was hit by super space junk. Moogi and Earth began a joint rescue - to rescue the cubes! Use Tao force!!<h2 class="bb_tag">How to Play</h2>  Select emoji category(big square button) to start a random game. A spaceship will be launched into the sapce with floating cubes.<br>  Pair and collect the floating cubes using Tao force.  Collected cube pairs provide a bit of energy for longer game time. Golden cubes provide more energy. Tao force, force shield( when cubes colliding with screen) and spaceship(screen) moving all consume energy. Game ends when energy exhausts.<br>  Each time cubes are collected, energy will be consumed a bit faster, the spaceship will move faster, the amount of different emojis will be bigger.<h2 class="bb_tag">Item Description</h2><h2 class="bb_tag">Tao Force Wave</h2>  When the spinning and shining wave emoji is pressed, a Tao force wave is emitted. All the cubes on screen will be affected the its power.

When spaceship is run out, only replay game can be started by pressing the highscore number or the &quot;key&amp;lock&quot; emoji. Spaceships can be exchanged from Tao force waves. The replay game start with the previous random seed(represented by the &quot;key&quot; emoji), so that players could get higher score by remembering the sequence of cubes. In replay game, collecting double golden cubes won't produce Tao force wave.<h2 class="bb_tag">Energy</h2>  The moon emoji represents the amount of energy.  The moon provides 100 base energy each time the game start.<h2 class="bb_tag">Star</h2>  A star provides 10 extra energy each time the game start. A star can be got for every integral multiple of 1000 of highscore. A star can be got if all the emojis in a category are collected. A star can be got if a valid share key is input.<h2 class="bb_tag">Meteor</h2>  A meteor will disappear after 7 days. Befor disappearing it's counted as a star. 20 waves can be exchagned to a metor.

Ever wanted to throw ridiculous amounts of toilet paper at giant viruses invading your home? Well here's your chance.<br><br>Operation COVID-19 is an endless first person shooter in which you can give those viruses what they deserve: blow them all up!<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1316570/extras/covid19_action.gif?t=1591987121" /><br><strong>FAST PACED</strong><br>We made the game and even we can't keep up.

Watch that overheat bar though! Once the weapon jams, you'll be deep in it. Should this happen, use the next strategy.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1316570/extras/covid19_pushforce.gif?t=1591987121" /><br><strong>PUSH FORCE</strong><br>When everything goes south, use the TP-Gun 1000™'s secondary function: the Push Force. For a second, the generated force field will push away any viruses trying to infect you and give you a short moment to catch your breath. Jedi style!<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1316570/extras/covid19_jump.gif?t=1591987121" /><br><strong>POWER JUMP</strong><br>Wait, what? There's more? Of course! When there are too many of them, activate the Power Jump function and the TP-1000 Gun™ will reverse gravity for you. That way, you can make it rain TP rolls from above and get rid of more dumb viruses.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1316570/extras/covid19_jumpthenpush.gif?t=1591987121" /><br><strong>COMBINE EVERYTHING.

I made this alone while in quarantine by teaching myself game logic in Unreal Engine 4 with YouTube tutorials.

I really hope you'll enjoy what I put together and for 1$ I think you'll have your money's worth out of it.

Presented by Cracking The Cryptic, YouTube’s most popular Sudoku channel, comes a new game featuring one of the most popular puzzle types:  Thermo Sudoku.<br><br>How does Thermo Sudoku work?  Well each sudoku grid contains thermometer shapes (often drawn to create themes) and digits on thermometers must increase as one moves further from the bulb end.  The interactions between the thermometers leads to new logical ideas and patterns that completely refreshes the standard sudoku solving experience. <br><br>As with their other games (‘Classic Sudoku’, ‘Sandwich Sudoku’ and ‘Chess Sudoku’), Simon Anthony and Mark Goodliffe (the hosts of Cracking The Cryptic) have personally crafted the hints for the puzzles.  So you know that every puzzle has been play-tested by a human being to ensure that the sudoku is interesting and fun to solve.  <br><br>In Cracking The Cryptic’s games, players start with zero stars and earn stars by solving puzzles.  The more puzzles you solve, the more stars you earn and the more puzzles you get to play.  Only the most dedicated (and cleverest) sudoku players will finish all the puzzles.  Of course the difficulty is carefully calibrated to ensure lots of puzzles at every level (from easy through to extreme).  Anyone familiar with their YouTube channel will know that Simon and Mark take pride in teaching viewers to be better solvers and, in these games, they always craft the puzzles with the mindset of trying to help solvers improve their skills.<br><br>Mark and Simon have both represented the UK many times at the World Sudoku Championship and you can find more of their puzzles (and lots of others) on the internet’s biggest sudoku channel Cracking The Cryptic.<br><br>Features:<br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>40 beautiful puzzles on launch <br></li><li>100 puzzles in all with regular updates to reach this total in the first year post launch.  <br></li><li>Hints crafted by Simon and Mark!</li></ul>

All 78 tracks (almost 4 hours) of this soundtrack were composed by the same person who made everything else in the game (Tobias Cornwall) between 2007 and 2010.<br><br>This soundtrack contains music from all three chapters, plus nine additional 'Piano Collections' pieces which were based on music from Chapter 1. More were planned for the other chapters' music, but only one (Emela) was completed (that's included).<br><br><strong>Importantly, this pack also contains a pdf with old notes about the plan for all of MARDEK's chapters</strong>, with added developer commentary from 2020. It's interesting seeing where the produced chapters 2 and 3 deviated from their original plans, and what the future was for MARDEK IV and beyond (&quot;vague&quot; is a good descriptor). Since making more MARDEK Chapters is impractical at this point, hopefully this might at least put some lingering wonderings to rest.<br><br>To access the pdf, use the &quot;Browse Local Files&quot; button and you'll find it in a folder there.<br><br>Pdfs of sheet music for the nine Piano Collections are also included!

As a human being pitted against the AI, use your instinct and adapt to new conditions, while enemies keep changing their tactics.

<h2 class="bb_tag">Prepare Your Ship!</h2>Your crew has disappeared from the ship and it's a long way home.  You have managed to configure the ship on automatic but you have a very limited amount of fuel.  You will be forced to make several well timed jumps to make it home before your fuel runs out.  In order to survive you will need to upgrade the&quot;automatic&quot; configuration of your ship in order to defend it against the aliens that may lie between you and home.<br><br><i>Galactic Solo Command is now available in 11 languages! English, German, Spanish, French, Italian, Arabic, Portuguese, Russian, Japanese, Korean and Simplified Chinese. </i><br><br>In Galactic Solo Command you experience the atmosphere of running a spaceship while trying to return home after the crew has mysteriously disappeared. It's a very dangerous trip, with every jump presenting a challenge with life or death decisions. What will you upgrade first?<br><br><i>System Include: Auto-Pilot, Sensors, Shields, Medical, Doors, Weapons, Life Support and Engineering.</i><br><br>Your weapon system provides greater offense and will eliminate the enemy ships more efficiently.  However, perhaps you should upgrade the shields in order to stop the enemy barrage. Preventing the enemy from damaging your ships system will be critical because you will begin to lose your precious configurations while the systems are down.  <br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1314970/extras/GameMap_Small.png?t=1591758761" /><br><br>The upgrades will require more power and if you overload the system you can expect bad things to happen to your ship.  All the while knowing that the enemy will attempt to board your ship and kill you so they can take home this prize.  This &quot;spaceship simulation&quot; allows you to take your ship on a perilous trip to get home.  With ever increasing difficulty you should be prepared for the worst.  See your results on the global and friends leaderboard.<h2 class="bb_tag">Key Features:</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Strategic Gameplay - Decide what systems to upgrade and first.<br></li><li>Risk leaving damage unattended in order to pursue additional upgrades.<br></li><li>Place an emphasis on defense and risk the boarding parties ever growing size to overtake you   before destroying the enemy ship<br></li><li>Three diverse alien races with class specific weapons and skills.<br></li><li>The Galaxy between you and home consists of three sectors with three jump points each.  Additionally, you will find three outposts where you can supply and repair.  The final conflict will be the federation battle who are blockading Earth and will attempt to stop you from getting home.<br></li><li>Time is of the essence and you may not linger.  Your jumps are timed and will provide you a short rest between battles in order to recover your ships' systems before engaging the Warp Drive! <br></li><li>Points are scored by accomplishing mission critical tasks and eliminating the enemies in a timely fashion.</li></ul>

Good morning, Doctor, <br />
<br />
Welcome to Field Hospital. Your job here is to decide whether a patient requires immediate treatment or not.<br />
<br />
Use any available information: family status, criminal records or medical testing. Don’t forget, that there are way more patients than you can treat at once and every decision has its consequences. <br />
<br />
You can’t save them all, but does everyone really deserve to be saved? Check carefully each case. Fates of some patients have direct influence over other’s and even over your own!<br />
<br />

Feylin - this is a pixel slasher, where you play as a small knight who needs to fend off endless waves of various enemies. Your main task is to destroy as many enemies as possible, for each hit with a sword on the enemy you are awarded a point, also at the start the knight has only 4 health points, for each hit of the enemy on the knight you lose one point, as soon as they end - you lose . The complexity of the game is in a variety of enemies, some will go for a break, while others will attack you from a distance. For each enemy, you need to take certain tactics and not let yourself be cornered. Healing bottles drop out randomly, which will replenish one health point and slightly help you in the battle.

A battle accountant there, George, is assigned the unenviable task of leaving the safety of the city in order to storm a nearby castle, slay the dragon, rescue the princess, and (most importantly) rescue the unpaid tax revenue. Meanwhile, Ayraw (the dragon), is tired of knights showing up to slay her, and is a bit jealous no one ever wants to rescue her. So she concocts a plan to trick George into rescuing her instead of rescuing the princess. Hijinks ensue as the two team up, the unlikely duo slowly growing closer through their shared adventure.</i><h2 class="bb_tag">Main Characters</h2><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1313890/extras/AlanaBio-600px.png?t=1592880238" /><br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1313890/extras/GeorgeBio-600px.png?t=1592880238" />

With this planetarium, you can learn and appreciate the beauty of a dark night sky.  Amateur astronomers can prepare their observations by having a real sense of where deep sky objects are through virtual reality, without relying on a GoTo  mount.

As a group of civilians trapped under siege, you’ll face the ordeal of surviving the invasion. Though you do not participate in the fighting, the castle’s fate is in your hands.<br><br>Support the last soldiers standing against overwhelming enemy forces. Craft supplies and manage your resources during the day, and scavenge through the fallen city during the night. You must stand until the rescue comes!<h2 class="bb_tag">ENDURE THE SIEGE</h2>You must support the soldiers with weapons and provisions. The wounded and sick also demand your care. But your resources are limited. You must find ways to preserve food, and develop your infrastructure to use your supplies more effectively.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1314280/extras/siege_gif_4_crafting_building_v3.gif?t=1592582272" /><h2 class="bb_tag">SCAVENGE THE FALLEN CITY</h2>Take the risk of sneaking into the fallen city plundered by the invaders. Under the cover of the night, you can find precious resources, trade with scavengers and other low-lifes, and help the surviving citizens – or exploit them. But be careful, enemy patrols keep watching the streets. You’re no warrior, so a fight is always the worst option. You must be smart to remain unseen... and alive.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1314280/extras/siege_gif_5_scavenge.gif?t=1592582272" /><h2 class="bb_tag">MAKE DECISIONS, FACE THE OUTCOME</h2>In a war like this, one dilemma might lead to another and no decision is clearly good or clearly bad. One person’s survival may come at the cost of another’s death, no matter if he’s friend or family. Sacrifices must be made – with no guarantee they’ll pay off. In these desperate circumstances, however, survival means more than just staying alive, as morale is paramount. When you have to choose between sustaining the soldiers’ strength and taking care of your own survival, what will you sacrifice?<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1314280/extras/siege_gif_3_decisions.gif?t=1592582272" /><h2 class="bb_tag">YOUR BACK AGAINST THE WALL</h2>A messenger had cut through the enemy lines to bring back reinforcements, but it will take weeks before help arrives. You’ll face hunger, wounds, diseases, and despair – but also the growing tensions between the civilians and the last defenders of the city. The soldiers won’t hold for long without your support and if the defense falls, the invaders will have no mercy. The odds are against you – what will you do to survive?<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1314280/extras/siege_gif_1_walls.gif?t=1592582272" /><h2 class="bb_tag">TELL YOUR OWN STORY</h2><strong>Gloria Victis: Siege</strong> is developed on a game editor platform we created with the goal of sharing it with the modding community along with the game itself – at the release if possible, or later as a free DLC.

<h2 class="bb_tag">Description</h2><br>For Tim, the matter of when or how it all began couldn’t be more superficial. For all he knows, he has always hated <i>her</i>. Cassandra. A girl who constantly seems to be one step ahead of him. The reminder of his weaknesses. A girl that beat him at running. From elementary school all the way to high school, what first started as a juvenile form of payback disguised as a unilateral rivalry soon derailed into a full-blown obsession that consumed every moment of Tim’s life. In fact, only when <i>she </i> unexpectedly quit high school did he realize how far gone he has always been. His raison d'être—the target of his loathing—had disappeared, and his motivation with it. Still, the world kept on spinning. Tim finished high school, went to university, made a friend, and forgot all about <i>her</i>.

&quot;The first and last Orphan to discover the unforgettable&quot;<br />
<br />
Enchantress is a first-person psychological thriller game, Inspired by Never Again and Town of Light<br />
<br />
The Player features Megan Sterling, the newest child to WhiteRose Orphanage during the 1930's. WhiteRose holds many dark secrets under the 'care' of a twisted Matron. A crimson trail has been left behind that must be uncovered through exploring the Orphanage, before mother finds YOU herself.<br />
<br />
The main mechanics of Enchantress are through an immersive user experience. Exploring rooms, uncovering secrets and reliving untold history. Enchantress adopts a unique and innovative 20th Century style to capture the precise moments that took place, but were hidden at the time, allowing the experience to become a part of reality.<br />
<br />
Enchantress is a Final Major University Project. I developed this game: levels, story and programming.
This is a single level demo of one of the story mode missions from Feud: Wild West Tactics. You can jump right in and get a feel for the game, its characters and some of the strategic options. The demo is only an exceptionally small taste of what the full game offers.<br />
<br />
Feud: Wild West Tactics is a turn based game all about gun blazing, shotgun blasting, knife stabbing and dynamite throwing action in the Wild West. Centered on the famous Hatfield and McCoy feud you’ll be able to play special storylines from each side with sets of unique characters, each with a ton of personality and grit! Learning how to use your posse effectively against the dangers of the world is the core of the game. Only the hardiest gunslingers can expect to go the distance and survive!<br />
<br />
When you get through with the story, you can try your hand at empire building in Western Saga mode. Based on traditional 4x strategy games, you’ll be able to capture resources on the map, research numerous upgrades, explore, investigate events, hold up wagon trains, hunt down wanted men, and most importantly drive the other enemy families off your land for good!
Venture through the levels with your robot pal to get to the end. You must be careful, those spikes are dangerous. If you were to touch those, you will explode. So good luck and have fun.<br />
<br />
Your main adjective is to get to the goal at the end of each level.<br />
<br />

<br />
   *go through the grassy fields. then enter the last level. This level puts all your skills to the test. <br />
<br />
Good Luck because there are no checkpoints.<br />

A year after Infinity Inc. put the cloning gun on the market, the world has fallen into chaos.<br />
People started cloning everything that came to their hands: money, food, energy and even themselves.<br />
How many clones will you need to end Douglas Infinity's authoritarian regime? Can you save your own authenticity in a world where everything is a copy?
