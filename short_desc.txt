A new captain joins Squad Three, taking the place of the rebel Gin Ichimaru. His name is Shusuke Amagai. Shusuke is an unknown captain who was away on a long-term assignment and has only recently returned to the Seireitei.
In the middle of the night, a strange Senkaimon opens in Karakura Town, and a mysterious team of three arrives in the World of the Living. That morning, when Ichigo and Rukia go to school, they get word of a Hollow sighting.
A mysterious team of three transfers into Ichigo's class. Their names are Rurichiyo Kasumiohji, Kenryu, and Enryu. Rurichiyo acts like a princess, and Kenryu and Enryu obsessively guard her surroundings.
Ichigo and Rukia assume the responsibility of being Rurichiyo's bodyguard. It is Rurichiyo's first time in the World of the Living, and she asks Ichigo to teach her about everything she sees. Rukia takes Rurichiyo out to play.
Since welcoming Shusuke Amagai as the new captain, Squad Three has been hard at work. But the duties Shusuke assigns them are tasks that one couldn't imagine a Soul Reaper doing. Izuru Kira senses the dissatisfaction of the squad members, and as Lieutenant, he decides to advise the new captain.
One morning, Rurichiyo suddenly disappears. Kenryu finds some indication that leads him to believe that she used the Kasumiohji Clan's private Senkaimon to return to the Soul Society. He heads back to the Soul Society along with Ichigo and Rukia to look for Rurichiyo.
Ichigo returns to the World of the Living, and he draws up a countermeasure at Kisuke Urahara's shop. According to Kisuke, there is a shortage of a kind of Reishi that is used as a raw material for merchandise at the shop.
Hanza Nukui, the leader of Gyokaku Kumoi's assassins, has misjudged the power of Ichigo and his friends, and has failed to assassinate Rurichiyo. He forms a unit of assassins, armed with powerful Bakkouto swords, and prepares to go back to the World of the Living.
Hanza Nukui and his team of assassins, armed with Bakkoutos, arrive in the World of the Living, and they challenge Ichigo and the others to fight. When Ichigo and Hanza take off to fight one on one, a creepy assassin, Jinnai Douko, appears before Rurichiyo, wielding a Bakkouto.
The respective battles of Rukia, Uryu, and Chad continue. Jinnai Douko becomes one with his Bakkouto, Retsurai, and keeps attacking. Rukia has a tough battle against Jinnai, whose whole body transforms into a weapon. Uryu, who is fighting against Kuzuryu, is trapped inside a sea of mist...
Hanza Nukui uses his Bakkouto, Saiga's weak point, to act as a trap for Ichigo. Ichigo ends up getting caught in Hanza's scheme, an expanse of mirrors. The mirrors take the memories of the captive and turn them into nightmares.
At a captain's meeting in the Soul Society, Shusuke Amagai proposes to the Thirteen Court Guard Squads that they train directly with the squads. But Kenpachi Zaraki and Mayuri Kurotsuchi speak out against the idea, and the captains object due to their lack of interest.
Ichigo and his friends have narrowly escaped Hanza Nukui's team's attacks. But Uryu and Chad have been inundated with the Spirit Energy of Bakkoutos, and Orihime's healing power doesn't seem to be working.
Rurichiyo has gone back to the Soul Society to take back control of the Kasumiohji Clan. Ichigo, Rukia, Kenryu, and Enryu follow her through the Senkaimon, and they barge in on Rurichiyo and Shu's wedding at the Kasumiohji palace.
Ichigo and Rukia are being chased down by the Thirteen Court Guard Squads after sabotaging Rurichiyo and Shu's wedding and taking Shu hostage. The Soul Reapers, led by Squads Two and Three, put out an intense search effort, but when dawn comes they still haven't found Ichigo and Rukia.
After Shu Kannogi tearfully tells Shusuke Amagai how he feels, Shusuke loses his feelings of ill will towards Ichigo and instead decides to help in their search for Rurichiyo. Ichigo worries that this would be considered an act of betrayal to the Thirteen Court Guard Squads on Shusuke's part.
The Soul Reapers stop chasing after Ichigo for the time being and focus on restoring order in the Seireitei. In the midst of it all, Jushiro Ukitake and Shunsui Kyoraku begin to question why Genryusai doesn't enter the Kasumiohji Clan's grounds.
The intense battle between Izuru Kira and Makoto Kibune continues at Squad Three's training facility. Makoto, who was tired of not being taken seriously despite possessing an overwhelming amount of Spiritual Pressure, took part in the Kasumiohji Clan's conspiracy in order to become the best Soul...
At the Head Captain's command, all the Soul Reapers of the Thirteen Court Guard Squads break into the Kasumiohji Clan's palace at once. The Kasumiohji Clan is a special aristocratic family who make the swords presented to the royal family.
The battle at the Kasumiohji Clan's palace between the Thirteen Court Guard Squads and the Kasumiohji Clan's assassins continues. Against the Soul Reapers, the assassins use Bakkoutos, which forcibly emit more power than the wielder himself can actually produce.
The chaos in the Kasumiohji Clan was all a scheme formulated by Shusuke Amagai. Shusuke joined the Thirteen Court Guard Squads in order to avenge his father's death at the hands of Head Captain Yamamoto. For years, Shusuke has been seeking an opportunity to kill him.
Shusuke Amagai wields both a Bakkouto, which seals the powers of Soul Reapers, and his Bankai, Raika Gouenkaku. Ichigo defends against Shusuke's Bankai while Hollowfied and counterattacks with his most powerful Getsugatensho.
The Hueco Mundo Arc, which was put on hold for the New Captain Shusuke Amagai Arc, resumes. Ichigo, Rukia, Uryu, Chad, and Renji break into Hueco Mundo, the headquarters of Sosuke Aizen and his Arrancars, to rescue Orihime.
Uryu and Renji thought they had escaped, but they find themselves back at Szayelaporro's palace. There, Szayelaporro, dressed in something new, shows up with a daring smirk on his face. His palace has been built exactly as he wishes.
After finding Nel hiding in the shadow of a rock, Nnoitora tells Ichigo's group that Nel is actually a former Espada. Ichigo and his friends were deceived so that Nel would enter deep into Las Noches.
Uryu and Renji continue fighting their clones. But no matter how many times they beat them, the clones turn back into liquid, multiply, and revive. The two of them expect a futile fight against these clones that keep increasing in number, but then, Uryu finds a slight difference between them and...
Nnoitora and Nelliel continue to battle. They are nearly equal in strength. The two of them used to fight side by side as fellow Espadas. However, Nnoitora always hated Nelliel and has challenged her to a duel a number of times, only to lose every time.
Nelliel regains her memory, and Pesche and Dondochakka realize that she is going to give her all in the battle against Nnoitora. In order to go fight with Nelliel, Pesche and Dondochakka summon all their strength.
Just when Nelliel and Nnoitora's battle is about to come to an end, something unexpected happens to Nelliel's body. Ichigo's group find themselves in a sticky situation yet again.
Byakuya visits Rukia, who is unconscious after being injured in the battle against Aaroniero Arruruerie. Zommari Rureaux, Espada Number 7, happens to be there, attempting to finish her off.
Zommari's technique, ?Amor,? takes control over anything its eyes gaze upon. He uses this power to control Rukia's body and use her as a shield. This angers Byakuya, and he releases his Bankai, Gokei Senbonzakura Kageyoshi, destroying Aaroniero's palace.
Szayelaporro is exasperated when his powers don't work at all against Mayuri Kurotsuchi, and he ends up being enveloped by Mayuri's Konjiki Ashisogijizo. Just then, something happens to Nemu, who was being held hostage.
Szayelaporro used his prisoner Nemu as a medium to come back to life. However, Nemu's body is permeated with the new medicine that Mayuri developed. Szayelaporro experiences the dreadful effects of the medicine himself?
Kenpachi goes after Nnoitora's eye and pierces his eye patch, but the eye patch was hiding a dreadful secret. Nnoitora celebrates a victory, but Kenpachi continues fighting and gets a thrill out of trying to cut Nnoitora.
When Kenpachi's eye patch comes off, releasing his Spiritual Pressure and true strength, Nnoitora invokes his sword attack, Santa Teresa. Ichigo and the others are surprised by the six-armed monstrous figure.
Nnoitora has never shown any mercy to his opponents, and he has always finished them off. Nnoitora's reason for fighting has always been purely to fight. He has been fighting and becoming stronger, hoping to someday die in battle.
After ending the battle against Shusuke Amagai, the noble Kasumiohji Clan tries to restore peace. But one day, Rurichiyo Kasumiohji, who supposedly became the head of the family, goes off to the World of the Living by herself after getting in a fight with Kenryu.
Rurichiyo and Kenryu's fight was over how to revitalize the Kasumiohji Clan. Rurichiyo is concerned about the low spirits of her people, and she wants to host a soccer tournament.
In the Soul Society 110 years ago, the Thirteen Court Guard Squads are made up of unfamiliar faces. The captain of Squad Five is the masked Visored, Shinji Hirako who currently resides in the World of the Living.
Kisuke Urahara replaces the newly promoted Kirio Hikifune as captain of Squad Twelve. Hiyori Sarugaki, lieutenant of Squad Twelve, cannot hide her dissatisfaction with the new captain.
Kisuke takes Hiyori to the Special underground Confinement Unit inside the Squad Two barracks. Nicknamed the Maggot's Nest, this place imprisons enlisted Thirteen Court Guard Squad members whose beliefs or actions have been deemed dangerous.
Nine years have passed since Kisuke Urahara was appointed captain of Squad Twelve. Bizarre deaths start to occur in the Rukon District where people disappear, leaving only their clothes behind.
Kensei Muguruma's and Mashiro Kuna's Spiritual Pressure disappears. The Seireitei deems this a dire situation. Kisuke Urahara, who sent Hiyori to Squad Nine, volunteers to go to the scene of their disappearance, as he is worried that she has yet to return.
At Squad Nine's camp, Shinji Hirako and the others run into Kensei Muguruma, who is donning a strange mask. Kensei starts to attack them, and he is too powerful to stop even with all of them combined.
Sosuke Aizen suddenly appears in front of Shinji Hirako and the others. He draws his sword on Shinji, who is agonized by his Hollow transformation and cannot move his body at will.
Ichigo and his friends leave Karakura Town with the intent of bringing Orihime back, and they continue fighting in Hueco Mundo. Nevertheless, Hollows continue to appear in the World of the Living.
